All you've got is us anymore
Hanging onto you
Gotta keep going on as a song as a ghost
Fades across the room

I've been waiting to hear good news
If it ever arrives then what will I use it for?
I've been waiting to hear good news
If it ever arrives then what will I use it for?

All you want is us anymore
Wonder why you do
Hasn't been going on since you saw it before
Hanging onto you

Cause I've been waiting to hear good news
If it ever arrives then what will I use it for?
I've been waiting to hear good news
If it ever arrives then what will I use it for?
I've been waiting to hear good news
If it ever arrives then what will I use it for
And I've been waiting to hear good news
If it ever arrives then what will I use it for?
