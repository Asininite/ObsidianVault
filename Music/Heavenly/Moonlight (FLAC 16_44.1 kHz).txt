You never saw it all
Knew it was coming
You might've let it in
Knew it was something
Come and light me up
All enough to turn around
I'll never hear you say
You mean to some
Oh what does it mean
Something in the moonlight
Looks like a fling
A hurricane
Oh what does it mean
Something in the silence
Sounds like a name
Without a thing
I never need you
Like I would have done
One more taken back
And more the second love
I'll tell the reverie
I'm lucky that I sing
You know you've mistaken my love
Until the reef
Oh what does it mean
We suffer from the moonlight
It keeps burning
You make this up
Why does it burn
Something in the silence
Sounds like a name
Remain the same
Oh it keeps burning
If you heard it
It keeps burning
If he heard it
