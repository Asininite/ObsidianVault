I hear them coming in
So start promising
That I'm the only one
When we're already gone

I hear them coming in
To start promising
And if I ever could
Then I already did

And when you wake them
Without reason
Am I the only one who's never really gone?
You get used to it
So start promising
That I'm the only one
That I'm the only one

Tear it up
And this will be the prize
I might
I might
Hear those unfeterred by the noises leaving
Off it goes
And shootes us on the drive to call though
Off it goes
And shootes us on the drive to call though
I'm still shaken

Reasons
Get used to it
Reasons
Get used to it

Am I the only one?
You get used to it
So star promising
That I'm the only one
