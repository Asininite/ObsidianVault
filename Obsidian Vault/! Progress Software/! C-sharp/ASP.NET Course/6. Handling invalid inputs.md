- use **System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations**

but just this wont work

we need a nuget package called `MinimalApis.Extensions`
- this package has a method called `WithParameterValidation()`
- we use that in the POST method definition in GameEndpoints.cs
- this is tied to rfc which is the standardized way to report errors
