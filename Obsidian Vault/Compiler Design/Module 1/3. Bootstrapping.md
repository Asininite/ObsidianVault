- create a self-hosting compiler : aka a compiler that can compile its own source code, making it self-sufficient

**Why is Bootstrapping Needed?**
- When you create a new programming language, you need a compiler to translate the source code of that language into machine code. However, to write the compiler, you need a working compiler in the first place. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem. Bootstrapping solves this problem by starting with a simple compiler (often written in another language) and gradually building up to a full-featured compiler written in the new language.
