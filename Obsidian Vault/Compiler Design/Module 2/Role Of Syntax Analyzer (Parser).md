- **source program** given as input to LA
- LA reads source program character by character and creates a token, then passes the token info to syntax analysis
- LA(scanner) stores **token information** in symbol table like attribute value, scope of the value
- SA(parser) sends **request** to the LA for another token, and LA sends another token
- SA sends a **parse tree** to semantic analysis 

- **What it is:** The second phase of compilation, following Lexical Analysis.
    
- **Input:** A stream of **tokens** generated by the Lexical Analyzer.
    
- **Primary Goal:** To check if the stream of tokens conforms to the grammatical structure of the source language. It verifies the **syntactical correctness**.
    
- **How it works:** It uses a formal grammar, specifically a **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)**, which defines the rules of the language.
    
- **Output:** If the token stream is syntactically correct, the parser typically constructs a tree-like intermediate representation, such as a **Parse Tree** or an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, which represents the grammatical structure. This tree is used by later phases (like Semantic Analysis and Code Generation).
    
- **Error Reporting:** If the token stream violates the grammar rules, the parser must report **syntax errors** clearly to the user.

Okay, let's break down the role of a parser, based on the explanation in the video.

Based on the video and search results, here's a breakdown of the role of a parser in the compilation process:

**Core Function: Syntax Analysis**

1.  **Grammar Verification:** The primary role of the parser (also called the Syntax Analyzer) is to take the sequence of tokens produced by the Lexical Analyzer (Scanner) and check if they conform to the grammatical rules (syntax) of the programming language. It determines if the structure formed by the tokens is valid according to the language's specifications.
2.  **Structure Imposition:** If the syntax is correct, the parser imposes a hierarchical structure on the tokens, typically by building a Parse Tree or an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This tree represents the grammatical structure of the code.

**Inputs and Outputs**

1.  **Input:** The parser receives a stream of tokens from the Lexical Analyzer.
2.  **Output (Success):** When the input tokens form a syntactically valid structure, the parser outputs a Parse Tree (or AST). This tree is then used by subsequent phases of the compiler, like Semantic Analysis and Code Generation.
3.  **Output (Failure):** If the tokens violate the language's syntax rules (e.g., missing semicolon, unbalanced parentheses), the parser detects these syntax errors and reports them, usually with messages indicating the nature and location of the error. The compilation process often stops until these errors are fixed.

**Interaction with Other Components**

1.  **Lexical Analyzer:** The parser requests tokens from the lexical analyzer as needed (often using a "get next token" function).
2.  **Symbol Table:** Both the parser and the lexical analyzer interact with the Symbol Table. The parser may use the Symbol Table to look up information about identifiers (like variables) encountered in the token stream, or help populate it.
3.  **Semantic Analyzer:** The Parse Tree generated by the parser is the primary input for the Semantic Analysis phase, which checks for meaning-related correctness (like type compatibility).

**Additional Roles**

1.  **Error Recovery:** Sophisticated parsers attempt to recover from errors to continue parsing the rest of the input, allowing them to detect multiple syntax errors in one compilation attempt.
2.  **Intermediate Code Construction:** The parse tree built by the parser is a crucial step towards generating intermediate code later in the compilation process.

In essence, the parser acts as the grammar checker of the compiler. It ensures the source code is structurally correct based on the language's rules and creates a structured representation (the parse tree) for further processing if the code is valid.
