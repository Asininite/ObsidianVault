- **source program** given as input to LA
- LA reads source program character by character and creates a token, then passes the token info to syntax analysis
- LA(scanner) stores **token information** in symbol table like attribute value, scope of the value
- SA(parser) sends **request** to the LA for another token, and LA sends another token
- SA sends a **parse tree** to semantic analysis 

- **What it is:** The second phase of compilation, following Lexical Analysis.
    
- **Input:** A stream of **tokens** generated by the Lexical Analyzer.
    
- **Primary Goal:** To check if the stream of tokens conforms to the grammatical structure of the source language. It verifies the **syntactical correctness**.
    
- **How it works:** It uses a formal grammar, specifically a **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)**, which defines the rules of the language.
    
- **Output:** If the token stream is syntactically correct, the parser typically constructs a tree-like intermediate representation, such as a **Parse Tree** or an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, which represents the grammatical structure. This tree is used by later phases (like Semantic Analysis and Code Generation).
    
- **Error Reporting:** If the token stream violates the grammar rules, the parser must report **syntax errors** clearly to the user.
