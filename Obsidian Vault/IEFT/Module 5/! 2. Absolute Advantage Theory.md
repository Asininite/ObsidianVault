- Countries **gain** by producing and specializing in goods that **they can produce efficiently**, and **importing goods others produce efficiently**

`Companies should specialize in producing the goods and services in which they have absolute advantage and engage in free trade with other countries to sell their goods`
`Production of goods/services in which there is a productivity advantage would maximize national wealth`
