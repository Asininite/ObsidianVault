The **Law of Variable Proportions** (also called the **Law of Diminishing Returns**) explains how output changes when one variable input is increased while keeping other inputs fixed. This occurs in the short run. Here's a structured breakdown:

---

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Total Product (TP)**: Total output produced by combining variable inputs (e.g., labor) with fixed inputs (e.g., land).  
2. **Marginal Product (MP)**: Additional output from using one more unit of the variable input.  
   $$
   MP = \frac{\Delta TP}{\Delta L}
   $$  
3. **Average Product (AP)**: Output per unit of the variable input.  
   $$
   AP = \frac{TP}{L}
   $$

### **Three Stages of the Law**
#### **Stage 1: Increasing Returns**
- **MP increases**, leading to **TP rising at an increasing rate**.  
- **Why?** Better utilization of fixed factors (e.g., specialization).  
- **AP also rises** but peaks after MP starts declining.  

#### **Stage 2: Diminishing Returns**
- **MP decreases but remains positive**, causing **TP to rise at a decreasing rate**.  
- **Why?** Fixed factors (e.g., land) become overcrowded, leading to inefficiency.  
- **AP starts declining** once MP < AP.  

#### **Stage 3: Negative Returns**
- **MP becomes negative**, and **TP declines**.  
- **Why?** Overuse of the variable input disrupts production (e.g., too many workers on a farm).

### **Example**
A farmer uses **fixed land** and increases **labor**:  
- **Stage 1**: Adding workers improves efficiency (e.g., division of labor).  
- **Stage 2**: More workers lead to congestion; output grows slower.  
- **Stage 3**: Excess workers cause chaos, reducing total output.  

---

### **Key Relationships**
- **MP and TP**:  
  - When MP > 0, TP increases.  
  - When MP = 0, TP is maximized.  
  - When MP < 0, TP decreases.  
- **MP and AP**:  
  - When MP > AP, AP rises.  
  - When MP < AP, AP falls.  
  - MP intersects AP at AP’s peak.

### **Assumptions**
1. Fixed technology.  
2. All variable input units are equally efficient.  
3. Input proportions can be altered.  

---

### **Graphical Representation**
- **TP Curve**: First rises steeply (Stage 1), then flattens (Stage 2), and finally declines (Stage 3).  
- **MP Curve**: Peaks early, crosses AP curve at AP’s peak, and eventually becomes negative.  
- **AP Curve**: Rises initially, peaks, then declines.  

---

### **Why It Matters**
- Helps firms determine **optimal input levels** to avoid inefficiency.  
- Explains why adding more inputs (e.g., labor) doesn’t always boost output proportionally.  

**Formula for Producer Equilibrium**:  
$$
\frac{MP_L}{P_L} = \frac{MP_K}{P_K}
$$  
*(Ratio of marginal product to price of inputs must be equal)*

By understanding this law, businesses can optimize production and avoid wasteful overuse of resources.
