- process of dividing an image into separate regions based on the characteristics of pixels to identify objects or boundaries to simplify an image and analyze it

## Scene Segmentation
- process of partitioning an digital image into multiple segments or regions based on their **semantic meaning**
- semantic segmentation aims to assign every single pixel in the image to a predefined category or class label corresponding to real-world objects or regions.
- **Think of it like:** Taking a photograph and meticulously coloring it in, using one specific color for every part that is "sky," another for every part that is "tree," another for every part that is "road," and so on, for every single pixel.

### Labeling
- assigning a **meaningful, human-understandable name** (the label) to the segments identified during segmentation.
- **Think of it like:** After coloring the photograph (segmentation), you create a legend that says "Purple = Road," "Blue = Car," "Red = Pedestrian."
