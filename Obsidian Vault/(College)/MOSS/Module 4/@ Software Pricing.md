**External Factors (Client & Market):**

- **Contractual Terms:** Fixed-price contracts often have higher initial prices to account for risk. Time and materials contracts can be more flexible but less predictable.
    
- **Market Opportunity:** Breaking into a new market might involve lower pricing initially.
    
- **Competition:** The presence of competitors offering similar services influences pricing.
    
- **Customer Budget and Perceived Value:** What the customer is willing to pay and how valuable they perceive the software to be.
    
- **Requirements Volatility:** If requirements are likely to change frequently, a higher price or a more flexible contract type might be necessary.
    
- **Marketing Requirements:** Release dates driven by marketing campaigns can influence project timelines and therefore cost.
    
- **Platform Changes:** Adapting to new platforms or operating systems can add to development costs.
    
- **Technical Quality of the System:** Higher quality requirements (e.g., for safety-critical systems) lead to higher development costs.
