Let's break down these software engineering concepts:

**1. Open Source Licensing and Open-Source Software Development:**

* **Open-Source Software (OSS):** Software with source code made available publicly, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and distribute the code.
* **Open-Source Development:** A collaborative development model where a community of volunteers contributes to a project's codebase.
* **Open-Source Licenses:** Legal agreements that govern the use, modification, and distribution of OSS.  They protect the rights of the original developers while granting permissions to others.
    * **Key License Types:**
        * **GPL (GNU General Public License):**  "Copyleft" license – requires derivative works to also be open source under the GPL.
        * **LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License):** Allows linking with proprietary software.
        * **BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) License:** Permissive license – allows modifications and redistribution, even in proprietary software, with attribution.
        * **MIT License:** Similar to BSD, very permissive, requiring only attribution.
        * **Apache License 2.0:**  Similar to BSD/MIT, but also includes a patent grant.
* **Benefits of OSS:** Cost-effective, flexible, community support, transparency, security.
* **Challenges of OSS:**  Sustainability, security vulnerabilities, licensing compliance.


**2. Design Patterns:**

* **Definition:** Reusable solutions to common software design problems.  They are templates or blueprints, not complete code.
* **Purpose:**  Improve code maintainability, reusability, and communication among developers.
* **Types of Design Patterns:**
    * **Creational Patterns:** Deal with object creation mechanisms. (e.g., Singleton, Factory)
    * **Structural Patterns:** Compose classes or objects into larger structures. (e.g., Adapter, Decorator)
    * **Behavioral Patterns:**  Identify common communication patterns between objects. (e.g., Observer, Strategy)
* **Benefits:**  Provide proven solutions, improve code organization, and facilitate communication.


**3. Configuration Management (CM):**

* **Definition:**  The process of managing changes to software systems and their components.  It ensures that changes are tracked, documented, and controlled.
* **Key Activities:**
    * **Version Control:** Tracking changes to code and other artifacts. (e.g., using Git)
    * **System Building:** Automating the process of compiling and linking code to create an executable system.
    * **Change Management:**  Managing requests for changes, assessing their impact, and approving or rejecting them.
    * **Release Management:**  Preparing and deploying software releases.
* **Benefits:**  Improved code quality, reduced errors, better collaboration, faster releases.


**4. Formal Technical Review (FTR):**

* **Definition:** A structured review process used to identify defects and improve the quality of software artifacts (e.g., requirements documents, design specifications, code).
* **Purpose:**  Early defect detection, improved communication, knowledge sharing, and adherence to standards.
* **Key Roles:**
    * **Moderator:** Leads the review meeting.
    * **Recorder:** Documents defects and other findings.
    * **Reviewers:**  Experts who evaluate the artifact.
    * **Author:** The creator of the artifact being reviewed.
* **Process:** Planning, preparation, review meeting, rework, follow-up.


**5. Black Box & White Box Testing:**

* **Black Box Testing:**  Testing without knowledge of the internal code. Focuses on functionality and requirements. (See previous response for more detail)
* **White Box Testing:** Testing with knowledge of the internal code. Focuses on code coverage and logic. (See previous response for more detail)

White box and black box testing are two fundamental approaches to software testing. They differ primarily in their level of access to the internal workings of the system being tested:

**Black Box Testing:**

* **Focus:** Tests the software's functionality from an external perspective, without any knowledge of its internal code structure, implementation details, or data flow.  It treats the system as a "black box."
* **How it works:** Testers provide inputs and observe the outputs, comparing them to the expected behavior outlined in the specifications.
* **Techniques:**
    * **Equivalence Partitioning:** Dividing input data into groups (partitions) that are expected to be treated similarly by the system.
    * **Boundary Value Analysis:** Testing values at the edges of valid input ranges.
    * **Decision Table Testing:** Defining test cases based on combinations of input conditions and their corresponding actions.
    * **State Transition Testing:** Modeling the system's behavior as a state machine and testing transitions between states.
    * **Use Case Testing:** Testing different scenarios or use cases of the software.
* **Advantages:**
    * Can be performed by testers without programming knowledge.
    * Focuses on user-level functionality and requirements.
    * Helps uncover inconsistencies in specifications.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * Potential for redundant testing if internal logic is not considered.
    * May not cover all possible execution paths.
    * Difficult to test specific internal functionalities.


**White Box Testing:**

* **Focus:** Tests the internal structure, code, and design of the software.  It requires knowledge of the system's implementation.
* **How it works:** Testers examine the code and design to create test cases that exercise specific paths, branches, and conditions within the software.
* **Techniques:**
    * **Statement Coverage:** Ensuring that every line of code is executed at least once.
    * **Branch Coverage:** Testing both true and false branches of every conditional statement.
    * **Path Coverage:** Testing all possible execution paths through the code.
    * **Control Flow Testing:** Analyzing the control flow graph of the program to design test cases.
    * **Data Flow Testing:** Tracking the flow of data through the program to identify potential errors.
* **Advantages:**
    * Thorough testing of internal logic and code paths.
    * Helps identify hidden errors and vulnerabilities.
    * Optimizes code performance and efficiency.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * Requires programming knowledge and access to source code.
    * Can be time-consuming and complex.
    * May not uncover errors related to user interface or system integration.



**Key Differences Summarized:**

| Feature        | Black Box Testing                  | White Box Testing                     |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Knowledge     | No internal knowledge required       | Internal knowledge required            |
| Focus         | Functionality, external behavior     | Code, structure, design                |
| Techniques    | Equivalence partitioning, etc.      | Statement coverage, branch coverage, etc.|
| Advantages    | Easy to perform, user-centric       | Thorough, finds hidden errors          |
| Disadvantages | May miss code paths, less thorough | Complex, requires code access         |


Often, both black box and white box testing are used in combination to provide comprehensive test coverage. Black box testing verifies that the software meets the user's requirements, while white box testing ensures the internal quality and robustness of the code.



**6. System Testing:**

* **Definition:** Testing the entire integrated system as a whole.  Focuses on verifying that the system meets its requirements in a real-world environment. (See previous response for more detail)

System testing is a crucial phase in software development where the entire integrated system is tested as a whole. It verifies that the system meets the specified requirements and performs as expected in a real-world environment.  Here's a breakdown of key aspects:
