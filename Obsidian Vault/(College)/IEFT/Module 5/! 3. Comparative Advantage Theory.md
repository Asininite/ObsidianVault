- **David Ricardo**
- even if companies did not have an **absolute advantage**, international trade would be beneficial and bring gains to all countries

`A company will specialize in production of goods in which it has a greater comparitive cost advantage than other countries and engage in trade of those goods in which they have a comparitive cost disadvantage`

### Assumptions
- labour is only relevant factor of production
- production exhibits constant returns to scale
- no transportation costs
- labour is mobile within a country but not between them
- perfect competition
- full employment of resources

- **domestic exchange ratio** : 12/10 = 1.2
- though england has the absolute advantage, comparing comparative costs of cloth and wheat
	  england has less comparative costs for cloth & more for wheat (1.2 < 1.33 && 0.83 > 0.75)
- england will produce and trade cloth to portugal
- portugal will produce and trade wheat to england

### Criticisms
- no costs except labour
- assumes constant returns to scale
	  **diminishing returns occurs in reality**
- ignores differences in transport costs
- labour mobile only in country is **not valid**
