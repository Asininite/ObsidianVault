Free trade is an economic policy where governments do not restrict imports or exports. In a free trade system, goods and services can be bought and sold across international borders with little to no government tariffs, quotas, subsidies, or prohibitions to hinder their exchange. The aim is to create a more open and competitive international marketplace.

Here are three arguments in favor of free trade:

1.  **Increased Economic Efficiency and Growth:** Free trade allows countries to specialize in producing goods and services where they have a comparative advantage â€“ meaning they can produce them at a lower opportunity cost. This specialization leads to a more efficient allocation of global resources. When countries focus on what they do best and trade for the rest, overall global output increases, leading to economic growth for the participating nations.

2.  **Lower Prices and Increased Choice for Consumers:** By removing trade barriers like tariffs, free trade reduces the cost of imported goods and services. This leads to lower prices for consumers, increasing their purchasing power. Additionally, consumers gain access to a wider variety of goods and services from around the world that might not be available domestically or would be more expensive to produce locally.

3.  **Increased Competition and Innovation:** Free trade exposes domestic firms to greater competition from foreign producers. This increased competition incentivizes domestic companies to become more efficient, cut costs, and improve the quality of their products and services to remain competitive. It can also spur innovation as businesses strive to develop new products and processes to gain an edge in the global market.
