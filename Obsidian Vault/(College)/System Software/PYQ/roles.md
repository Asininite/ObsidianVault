Here are the roles of an operating system, assembler, compiler, and linker in a computer system:

- **Operating system**
    
    Distributes tasks among processors in a system with more than one CPU. It also handles communication between processors. 
    
- **Assembler**
    
    Translates assembly language into machine code. Assembly language is a low-level language, and the machine code is binary code that a specific processor can recognize. 
    
- **Compiler**
    
    Converts high-level programming languages into machine code. Compilers can also produce intermediate object code. 
    
- **Linker**
    
    Combines object files into a single executable program, library file, or another object file. Linkers prefer to link with shared libraries unless the -static option is used.
