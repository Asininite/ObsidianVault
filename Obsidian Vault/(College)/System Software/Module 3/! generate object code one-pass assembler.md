- if operand has undefined symbol, **use 0 as address** and write text record
- forward references are entered into lists
- when definition of a symbol encountered, assembler generates another text record with correct operand address of each entry in reference list
- when loading, 0 addresses are updated by the new text record with the correct operand addresses
