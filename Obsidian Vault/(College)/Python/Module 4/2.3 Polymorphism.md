Polymorphism is defined as the circumstance of occurring in several forms. It refers to the usage of a single type entity (method, operator, or object) to represent several types in various contexts. Polymorphism is made from 2 words – **‘poly‘ and ‘morphs.’ The word ‘poly’ means ‘many’ and ‘morphs’ means ‘many forms.’** Polymorphism, in a nutshell, means having multiple forms. To put it simply, polymorphism allows us to do the same activity in a variety of ways.

Polymorphism has the following advantages:  

- It is beneficial to reuse the codes.
- The codes are simple to debug.
- A single variable can store multiple data types

Polymorphism may be used in one of the following ways in an object-oriented language:  

- Overloading of operators
- Class Polymorphism in Python
- Method overriding, also referred to as Run time Polymorphism
- Method overloading, also known as Compile time Polymorphism

Polymorphism is supported in Python via method overriding and operator overloading

### Method Overriding
```python
  
class Animal:  
    def speak(self):  
        pass  
  
class Dog(Animal):  
    def speak(self):  
        print("Woof!")  
  
class Cat(Animal):  
    def speak(self):  
        print("Meow!")  
  

dog = Dog()  
dog.speak() # Prints "Woof!"  
  
cat = Cat()  
cat.speak() # Prints "Meow!"
```

### Operator Overloading
```python

```
