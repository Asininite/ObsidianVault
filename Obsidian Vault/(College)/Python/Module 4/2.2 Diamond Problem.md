Great question! The **diamond problem** is a classic issue in **multiple inheritance** in object-oriented programming. It occurs when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from the **same base class**, creating a diamond-shaped inheritance structure.

### ðŸ”· The Diamond Problem Structure
       A
     / \
    B   C
     \ /
       D

- Class `B` and class `C` both inherit from class `A`.
    
- Class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`.
    

Now, suppose class `A` has a method `say_hello()`. If both `B` and `C` override it, and `D` tries to use `say_hello()`, **which version should it use?**  
This **ambiguity** is the diamond problem.

### ðŸ”· Example Without `super()`
```python

class A:
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello from A")

class B(A):
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello from B")

class C(A):
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello from C")

class D(B, C):
    pass

d = D()
d.say_hello()

`Hello from B`
```


Python resolves the ambiguity using **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** â€” it looks **left to right** in the class definition: `class D(B, C)`. So it finds `say_hello` in `B` first.

### ðŸ”· How Python Solves It: `super()` + MRO

Using `super()` and cooperative multiple inheritance, Python ensures that each method in the chain is called once and in order:

MRO must prevent local precedence ordering and also provide monotonicity. It ensures that a class always appears before its parents. In case of multiple parents, the order is the same as tuples of base classes.

MRO of a class can be viewed as theÂ **__mro__ attribute or the mro()**Â method. The former returns a tuple while the latter returns a list.

```python
class A:
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello from A")

class B(A):
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello from B")
        super().say_hello()

class C(A):
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello from C")
        super().say_hello()

class D(B, C):
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello from D")
        super().say_hello()

d = D()
d.say_hello()
print(D.mro())
```

#### ðŸ”¸ Output:

```
Hello from D
Hello from B
Hello from C
Hello from A

```

Pythonâ€™s `super()` works with the **C3 linearization algorithm** to determine the order. You can see this using:



```python
print(D.mro())
```

### âœ… Summary

- The **diamond problem** is an ambiguity in multiple inheritance when two paths lead to the same base class.
    
- Python resolves it using **MRO (Method Resolution Order)** and **`super()`**.
    
- Use `super()` in all classes to ensure proper method calls and avoid duplication.
