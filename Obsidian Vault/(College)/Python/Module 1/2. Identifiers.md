**1. Identifiers**
*   **Definition:** Identifiers are the names you give to different entities in your Python programs. Think of them as labels for things like variables (which store data), functions (blocks of reusable code), classes (blueprints for creating objects), modules (files containing Python code), and other objects.
*   **Rules for Framing Identifiers:** Python has specific rules you must follow when creating these names:
    1.  **Allowed Characters:** Identifiers can be a combination of:
        *   Lowercase letters (a to z)
        *   Uppercase letters (A to Z)
        *   Digits (0 to 9)
        *   An underscore (`_`)
        *   **Valid Examples:** `myClass`, `var_1`, `print_this_to_screen`
    2.  **Cannot Start with a Digit:** An identifier cannot begin with a number.
        *   **Invalid Example:** `1variable` (This will cause a syntax error)
        *   **Valid Example:** `variable1`
    3.  **Keywords Cannot Be Used:** Keywords are special reserved words in Python that have predefined meanings and purposes. You cannot use these keywords as identifiers.
        *   **Invalid Example:** `global = 1` (because `global` is a keyword)
    4.  **No Special Symbols:** You cannot use special symbols like `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, etc., within an identifier.
        *   **Invalid Example:** `a@ = 0`
    5.  **Any Length:** Identifiers can theoretically be of any length. However, it's good practice to keep them concise yet descriptive.

*   **Things to Remember about Identifiers:**
    *   **Case-Sensitive:** Python treats uppercase and lowercase letters differently. So, `myVariable` and `myvariable` would be considered two distinct identifiers.
        *   **Example:** `X` and `x` are not the same.
    *   **Meaningful Names:** Always try to choose names that clearly indicate the purpose of the identifier. While `c = 10` is valid, `count = 10` is much more understandable, especially when you revisit your code later.
    *   **Multi-word Identifiers:** For identifiers made up of multiple words, a common convention is to separate the words using an underscore. This is often called "snake_case."
        *   **Example:** `this_is_a_long_variable`

**2. Variables**
*   **Definition:** A variable is a named location in memory used to store a value or an object. In Python, everything (numbers, text, functions, etc.) is treated as an object. A variable acts as a reference or a pointer to that object.
*   **Creation and Dynamic Typing:**
    *   A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. There's no separate "declaration" step as in some other languages.
    *   Python uses **dynamic typing**, which means you don't have to specify the type of the variable (e.g., integer, string) beforehand. The type of the variable is automatically determined by the type of the value assigned to it.

*   **Examples:**
    ```python
    x = 'binu'  # x is a variable storing a string object
    y = 23      # y is a variable storing an integer object
    z = 24.5    # z is a variable storing a floating-point object
    l = 399379379379387983793773973977000102 # l stores a long integer (in Python 3, this is just a standard int)
    ```

*   **Checking Variable Type (`type()`):**
    You can use the built-in `type()` function to find out the type of the object a variable refers to.
    ```python
    # Continuing from the examples above:
    print(type(x))  # Output might be: <class 'str'> (in Python 3) or <type 'str'> (as in the text, for Python 2)
    print(type(y))  # Output might be: <class 'int'>  or <type 'int'>
    print(type(z))  # Output might be: <class 'float'> or <type 'float'>
    print(type(l))  # Output might be: <class 'int'> or <type 'long'>
    ```
    *(Note: The text uses `<type 'str'>` which is Python 2 syntax. In Python 3, it's typically `<class 'str'>`.)*

*   **Exploring Object Attributes/Methods (`dir()`):**
    The `dir(object)` function can be used to get a list of attributes and methods associated with an object. This can be helpful for understanding what operations you can perform with that object.

*   **Purpose:** The primary purpose of variables is to capture and store data so that it can be manipulated by your program to provide information or perform actions.

*   **Mutability:**
    *   **Mutable Variable:** A mutable variable refers to an object whose value can be changed "in place" (i.e., without creating a new object). Lists and dictionaries are examples of mutable types.
    *   **Immutable Variable:** An immutable variable refers to an object whose value cannot be changed after it's created. If you "change" the value of an immutable variable, Python actually creates a new object with the new value and the variable then refers to this new object. Numbers, strings, and tuples are examples of immutable types.

*   **Things to Remember about Variables:**
    1.  **Created on First Assignment:** Variables don't exist until you assign them a value.
    2.  **Type Determined by Value:** The data type of the variable is set by the value it holds.
    3.  **Must Be Assigned Before Use:** You must assign a value to a variable before you can use it in an expression or try to read its value. Trying to use an unassigned variable will result in a `NameError`.
    4.  **Refer to Objects:** Variables are essentially names that point to objects in memory.
    5.  **No Advance Declaration:** You don't declare variables ahead of time with their types.

**3. Keywords**

*   **Definition:** Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special, predefined meanings and functionalities. They form the basic syntax and structure of the Python language.
*   **Restrictions:**
    *   You **cannot** use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier.
    *   Keywords are **case-sensitive**. You must use them exactly as they are defined (mostly lowercase, with `True`, `False`, and `None` being exceptions).
*   **Number of Keywords:** The text mentions there are 36 keywords in Python 3.12. This number can change slightly between Python versions.
*   **Case Convention:** All keywords are in lowercase, **except for** `True`, `False`, and `None`.
*   **List of Keywords (as per the text for Python 3.12):**
    |           |          |          |         |        |
    | :-------- | :------- | :------- | :------ | :----- |
    | `False`   | `None`   | `True`   |         |        |
    | `and`     | `as`     | `assert` | `async` | `await`|
    | `break`   | `class`  | `continue`| `def`   | `del`  |
    | `elif`    | `else`   | `except` | `finally`| `for`  |
    | `from`    | `global` | `if`     | `import`| `in`   |
    | `is`      | `lambda` | `nonlocal`| `not`   | `or`   |
    | `pass`    | `raise`  | `return` | `try`   | `while`|
    | `with`    | `yield`  |          |         |        |

*   **Getting the List of Keywords Programmatically:**
    You can use the `keyword` module in Python to get the current list of keywords for your Python version:
    ```python
    import keyword
    print(keyword.kwlist)
    ```    This would output:
    ['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']
    ```

**Summary (from the text)**
*   **Identifiers:** Names for variables, functions, etc. Must follow specific rules.
*   **Variables:** Containers for storing data values.
*   **Keywords:** Reserved words with special meanings in Python.
