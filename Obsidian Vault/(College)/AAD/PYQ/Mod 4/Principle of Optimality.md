 Definition: The principle of optimality states that an optimal sequence of decisions
has the property that whatever the initial state and decision are, the remaining
decisions must constitute an optimal decision sequence with regard to the state
resulting from the first decision.

 A problem is said to satisfy the Principle of Optimality if the subsolutions of an
optimal solution of the problem are themesleves optimal solutions for their
subproblems.

 Examples:
 The shortest path problem satisfies the Principle of Optimality.
 This is because if a,x1,x2,...,xn,b is a shortest path from node a to node b in a
graph, then the portion of xi to xj on that path is a shortest path from xi to xj
