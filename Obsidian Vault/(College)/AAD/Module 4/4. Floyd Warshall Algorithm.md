- so take the original matrix (with all the infinities)
- take 1 node (first node / A1) as intermediate node and compare the distances in previous matrix ($D[i,j]$) with the distance in the intermediate matrix ($D[i,k] \ + \ D[k,j]$) and substitute the **minimum** sum in the matrix
- with this new matrix, take 2 as the intermediate node and repeat until **all nodes are covered** 
- **always keep the row, column and diagonal of the intermediate node as constant**
