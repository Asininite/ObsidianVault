- **Data Bus:** The 8086's 16-bit data bus allows it to transfer twice as much data in a single operation compared to the 8085. This significantly improves data transfer speed.
    
- **Address Bus:** The 20-bit address bus of the 8086 enables it to access a much larger memory space (1MB) than the 8085 (64KB).
    
- **Instruction Queue and Pipelining:** The 8086 incorporates an instruction queue and a pipelined architecture, where the Bus Interface Unit (BIU) fetches instructions while the Execution Unit (EU) executes them. This overlapping of instruction fetch and execution improves performance.
    
- **Memory Segmentation:** The 8086 uses a segmented memory model to address its larger memory space. While more complex than the 8085's memory addressing, it allows for better memory management and code relocation.
    
- **Interrupts:** The 8086 has a more sophisticated interrupt system, providing more interrupt types and flexible handling.
    
- **Addressing Modes:** The 8086 offers a wider range of addressing modes, making it more flexible in accessing memory operands.
    
- **Co-processor Support:** The 8086 is designed to work with a dedicated math co-processor (the 8087), which can significantly accelerate floating-point calculations.
    
- **Instruction Set:** The 8086's instruction set is richer and more complex than the 8085's, providing more powerful instructions and operations.
