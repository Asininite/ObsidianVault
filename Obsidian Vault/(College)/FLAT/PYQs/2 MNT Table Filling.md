  yes if D is the final state you will mark all the AD BD CD squares
- recheck and mark pairs (like AC) whose 0 transitions and 1 transitions land on the marked squares
- do until you get the unmarked squares
- combine the unmarked squares they are equivalent
- look at their 1 and 2 transitions and mark them accordingly
