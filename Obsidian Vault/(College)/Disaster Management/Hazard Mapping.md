- graphical representation of location, magnitude and temporal characteristics of hazards on 2D or 3D surfaces

- Natural Hazards
- Human-induced hazards
	  human activities aggravating damaging events
	  oil spills, atmospheric pollution
- technological hazards
	  industrial or technological activities
	  nuclear activities, radioactivity 

### Data requirements of hazard mapping
- Base maps
	  represents topographic layers of data like elevation, road, water bodies, cultural features, utilities
- remotely sensed images
	  satellite images depending on sensor and resolution
- Field data
	  ground surveying systems
	  GPS 
	  Laser scanners

### Approaches to Hazard Mapping
- Geographic Information System (GIS)
	  ![[Pasted image 20241212011808.png]]

- Participatory Mapping
	  draws on local people's knowledge and allows them to create visual/non-visual data to explore problems
	  
	  data collection
		  gather info about study area like resources, hazards
		interpretation and analysis
			make sense of collected data and use it to answer questions about study area
		presentation and communication
			presenting the findings in an understandable way and manner

	Preparation
		scouting
			investigation of study area
		design instruments
			develop tools and methods for collecting data from the community
			
	2. **Implementation:** This typically involves a series of sessions with the community:
	    - **Participant Preparation:** Introducing the participants to the mapping process and explaining the objectives.
	    - **Field Trip/Mapping Exercise:** The core activity where participants create maps, often using simple materials like paper, markers, and local knowledge.
	    - **Presentations:** Participants share their maps and discuss the information they have represented.
	    - **Debriefing:** Reflecting on the mapping experience and identifying key findings and next steps.
