### IP Address
- built upon 32 bits expressed in 4 8-bit octets
- **Network ID part** : network the IP address belongs to
- **Host ID Part** : host identifier of the device for the network

- binary notation
- dotted-decimal notation
### Classful addressing
- Class A : 0 - 127
- Class B : 128 - 191
- Class C : 192 - 223
- Class D : 224 - 239
- Class E : 240 - 255

### Number of networks and hosts per class
- number of networks = 2^networkbits
- number of hosts per network = 2^hostbits - 2 (2 cannot be assigned to hosts, they are used as network address and loopback address)
