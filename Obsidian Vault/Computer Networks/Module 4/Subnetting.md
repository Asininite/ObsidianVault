## Fixed Length Subnetting (CLASSFUL)
- all subnets same size
	  equal number of hosts
		  same subnet mask

## Variable Length Subnetting (CLASSLESS)
- all subnets not same size
	- unequal number of hosts
		- not same subnet mask

to design subnetwork
- Network ID
- Broadcast ID
- First Host ID
- Last Host ID

### Subnet Mask
- used to distinguish network part and host part in IP
- 32 bits long
- IP address in binary ANDED with subnet mask to form network address

A 255.0.0.0
B 255.255.0.0
