### Virtual-Circuit Subnet
- Avoids having to use a new route for every packet
- When connection established, a route from the source to destination is **chosen** as part of connection setup and **stored in tables inside router**
- Route used for all traffic (think **telephone connection**)
- Connection released : Virtual Circuit **terminated**
