**- Too many packets present in (a part of) the network causes packet delay and loss that degrades performance.**

### Factors
1. arrival rate more than outgoing rate 
2. insufficient memory to store packets
3. slow CPU in routers
4. bursty traffic : spikes in traffic

In general, we can divide congestion control mechanisms into two broad categories: 

- Open-loop congestion control 
	In open-loop congestion control, policies are applied to prevent congestion before it happens.
	In these mechanisms, congestion control is handled by either the source or the destination
- Closed-loop congestion control
