# Adaptive Algorithm

- changes routing to reflect changes in topology and traffic

- [ ] where they get info
      when they change routes
	      what metric used to measure

# Non-Adaptive Algorithm

- choice of route is computed in advance, downloaded to routers when network is booted
- does not depend on topology or traffic
- **static routing**
