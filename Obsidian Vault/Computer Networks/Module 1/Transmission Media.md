### Twisted Pair
- UTP : Unshielded Twisted Pair
	  commonly used in ethernet networks 
	  low cost and easy to install
	  ![[Pasted image 20241119155501.png]]
- STP : Shielded Twisted Pair
	  expensive and harder than UTP
	  more protection against EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)

### Coaxial Cables
![[Pasted image 20241119155307.png]]
- concentric layers of electric conductors and insulators
- primary copper conductor wrapped by a plastic insulator, then braided conductor then protective hard plastic
- inflexible but can withstand EMI 

### Fiber Optic Cables
![[Pasted image 20241119155431.png]]
- data transmitted as light pulses along a glass or plastic fiber
- Core : central tube of optically transparent medium
  Cladding : higher refractive index than core, keeps light within core
  Plastic Packet : Protects the fiber
