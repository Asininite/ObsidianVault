### Throughput
- Throughput = Total Data Transmitted / Total Time Taken
### Transit Time
- time for message to travel from one device to another

### Response Time
- Elapsed time between inquiry and a response

### Uptime
- amount of time a wireless network is available for use
### Jitter
- variability in delay time

### Latency
- Measure of time taken in transfer of data from one point in the network to another
- Latency = Time of Arrival at Destination - Time of Transmission from Source

### Error Rate

- Definition: The number of errors that occur during transmission (corrupted bits or packets).
- Formula: Bit Error Rate (BER) = Number of Error Bits / Total Number of Bits Transmitted
- Units: Expressed as a ratio (e.g., 10^-6 means one error bit per million bits).
