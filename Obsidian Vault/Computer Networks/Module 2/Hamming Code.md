[[Module 2 Syllabus]]
- All bits of power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8) are parity bits

### Rules
- Value of parity bits is determined by sequence of bits that is alternatively checks and skips

For P1 : check 1 bit, skip 1 bit, check 1 bit, ...
	(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...)
For P2 : check 2 bit, skip 2 bit, check 2 bit ...
	(2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, ...)
