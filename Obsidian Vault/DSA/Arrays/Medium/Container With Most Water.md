You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

```cpp BRUTE FORCE
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int maxarea = 0;
        for (int left = 0; left < height.size(); left++) {
            for (int right = left + 1; right < height.size(); right++) {
                int width = right - left;
                maxarea = max(maxarea, min(height[left], height[right]) * width);
            }
        }
        return maxarea;
    }
};
```
- this is inefficient and for larger areas can result in a TLE error. What this does is go through every combination of area of the rectangle

- we can optimize solution by using two pointers, left and rigth
- left is initialized to first index, right to last
