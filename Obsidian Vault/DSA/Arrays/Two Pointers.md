**What is the two-pointer technique?**

- It is a common pattern in software development that involves using two pointers to compare two elements in a collection.
- It is often used in technical interviews and can be applied to strings, arrays, and linked lists.

**When to use the two-pointer technique**

- When you need to analyze each element of a collection compared to its other elements.
- When you need to find a pair of elements that satisfy a certain condition, such as adding up to a target value.
- When you need to detect cycles in linked lists.

**Two main variations of the two-pointer technique:**

1. **Two pointers that start at the beginning and move inwards until they meet:**
    - This pattern is often used to find a pair of elements that satisfy a certain condition, such as adding up to a target value.
    - Example: Two Sum problem
2. **Two pointers that start at the beginning and move at different speeds:**
    - This pattern is often used to detect cycles in linked lists.
    - Example: Detecting cycles in linked lists

**Example: Two Sum problem**

- Given a sorted array of integers, find the pair of elements that add up to a given target value.
- Solution:
    
    1. Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning of the array and one at the end.
    2. While the two pointers have not met:
    
    - If the sum of the elements pointed to by the two pointers is equal to the target value, return the indices of the two elements.
    - If the sum is less than the target value, move the left pointer to the right.
    - If the sum is greater than the target value, move the right pointer to the left.

**Example: Detecting cycles in linked lists**

- Given a linked list, determine if it contains a cycle.
- Solution:
    1. Initialize two pointers, one slow and one fast.
    2. Move the slow pointer one step at a time and the fast pointer two steps at a time.
    3. If the two pointers ever meet, then a cycle exists in the linked list.

**Benefits of the two-pointer technique**

- It can help to reduce the time complexity of algorithms from O(n^2) to O(n).
- It can make code more concise and easier to read.
