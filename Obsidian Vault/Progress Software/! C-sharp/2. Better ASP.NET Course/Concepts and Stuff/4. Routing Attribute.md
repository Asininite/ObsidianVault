Excellent question! Understanding `[Route]` is key to knowing **how ASP.NET Core maps URLs to your code**.

---

## 🔹 What is `[Route]`?

### ✅ Technical Name: **Routing Attribute**

- `[Route]` is an **attribute** in ASP.NET Core that **defines the URL pattern** that should be matched for a controller or an action method.
    

### 🔍 Purpose:

> `[Route]` tells the ASP.NET Core framework:  
> **"This method or controller should respond when someone makes a request to this specific URL path."**

## 🔧 Why is `[Route]` used?

|Reason|Explanation|
|---|---|
|✅ Match URL paths|It connects incoming HTTP requests to the correct controller method.|
|✅ Custom URLs|You can design clean, readable, RESTful URLs (like `/api/stocks/5`).|
|✅ Control over endpoints|You get full control over how your API is structured.|

## 🧪 Example: Using `[Route("{id}")]`

```csharp
[HttpPut]
[Route("{id}")]
public IActionResult Update([FromRoute] int id, [FromBody] UpdateStockRequestDto dto)
```

### What happens here:

- If a PUT request is made to:  
    👉 `/api/stocks/5`
    
- Then:
    
    - ASP.NET matches the `5` to `{id}` in the route
        
    - The method `Update()` is called
        
    - The value `5` is passed into the `id` parameter

## 🔧 Controller-Level Route + Method-Level Route

You can combine both for clarity:

```csharp
[Route("api/stocks")] // Controller-level route
public class StockController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPut]
    [Route("{id}")] // Method-level route
    public IActionResult Update(int id, UpdateStockRequestDto dto) { ... }
}
```

👆 This results in a **final route** of:  
**`PUT /api/stocks/5`**

## ✨ More Route Examples

|Attribute|Matches URL|
|---|---|
|`[Route("api/products")]`|`/api/products`|
|`[Route("{id}")]`|`/api/products/10` (if applied inside a controller with base route)|
|`[Route("details/{symbol}")]`|`/api/stocks/details/AAPL`|
|`[Route("search/{industry}/{minCap}")]`|`/api/stocks/search/tech/1000000000`|

## ✅ Summary

|Feature|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`[Route]`|Defines the URL path for a controller or method|
|Why it’s used|To connect incoming HTTP requests to the correct method|
|Works with|`[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, `[HttpPut]`, `[HttpDelete]`, etc.|
|`{parameter}`|Path variable (e.g., `{id}` becomes a method parameter)|
