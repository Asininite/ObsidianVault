Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `ith` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return _the minimum integer_ `k` _such that she can eat all the bananas within_ `h` _hours_.


### Best Approach
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
int minimumRateToEatBananas(vector<int> nums, int h) {  
        int l = 1;
        // minimum rate
        int r = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        // maximum rate
        int ans = r;

		// binary search
        while(l <= r){
	        // for edge cases where nums[i] values are obstinately large
            long long time = 0;
            // also important that time resets every iteration where we check
            // if the rate is enough
            int m = (l+r)/2;
            for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
                time += (nums[i] + m - 1) / m; 
                // this is ceiling function
                // suppose bananas is 8 and rate is 5, so we need two turns 
                // to finish them
                // the ceiling function will calculate ceil(8/5) == 2
                // and solve this problem
            }

            if(time > h){
                l = m + 1;
                // time is too much so increase the rate
            } else {
                r = m - 1;
                ans = min(ans,m);
                // time is within the bounds so search for a lower rate and
                // save the already found rate
            }
        }
		// return rate
        return ans;
    }
};

```
