Given an array arr of integers. A peak element is defined as an element greater than both of its neighbors. Formally, if arr[i] is the peak element, **arr[i - 1] < arr[i]** and **arr[i + 1] < arr[i]**. Find the index(0-based) of a **peak** **element** in the array. If there are multiple peak numbers, return the index of any peak number.
Note: As there can be many peak values, 1 is given as output if the returned index is a peak number, otherwise 0.

Examples:
Input : arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 1]
Output: 7
Explanation: In this example, there is only 1 peak that is at index 7.

Input : arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation: In this example, there are 2 peak numbers at indices 1 and 5. We can consider any of them.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int> &arr) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = arr.size() - 1;
        int n = arr.size();
        
        if(arr[0] > arr[1]){
            return 0;
        } else if(arr[n-1] > arr[n-2]) {
            return n-1;
        } 

        while(l < r){
            int m = (l + r)/2;

            if(arr[m] > arr[m-1] && arr[m] > arr[m+1]){
                return m;
            } else if (arr[m+1] > arr[m]){
                l = m;
            } else if(arr[m-1] > arr[m]) {
                r = m;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
