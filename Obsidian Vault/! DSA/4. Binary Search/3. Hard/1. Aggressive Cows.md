Given an array nums of size n, which denotes the positions of stalls, and an integer k, which denotes the number of aggressive cows, assign stalls to k cows such that the **minimum** **distance** between any two cows is the **maximum possible**. Find the maximum possible minimum distance.

Examples:
Input: n = 6, k = 4, nums = [0, 3, 4, 7, 10, 9]
Output: 3
Explanation: The maximum possible minimum distance between any two cows will be 3 when 4 cows are placed at positions [0, 3, 7, 10]. Here the distances between cows are 3, 4, and 3 respectively. We cannot make the minimum distance greater than 3 in any ways.

Input : n = 5, k = 2, nums = [4, 2, 1, 3, 6]
Output: 5
Explanation: The maximum possible minimum distance between any two cows will be 5 when 2 cows are placed at positions [1, 6].

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    bool CanPlaceCows(vector<int> &nums, int k, int m){
        int count = 1; // since the first aggressive cow is always placed at first index
        int lastPos = nums[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++){// iterating over the array and checking the distances
            if(nums[i] - lastPos >= m){
                count++;
                lastPos = nums[i];
                if(count == k) return true; // if count is the same as number of cows we know the distance is enough
            }
        }
        return false; 
    }

public:
    int aggressiveCows(vector<int> &nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int l = 1; // minimum distance is literally placing two cows adjacent
        int r = nums.back() - nums.front(); // max distance is distance b/w stalls at both ends
        int ans = 0;

        while(l <= r){
            int m = (l + r)/2; // classic binary search

            if(CanPlaceCows(nums,k,m)){
                ans = m;
                l = m + 1; // given distance is sufficient and we are searching for a larger possible distance
            } else { // distance is too much so we decrease it
                r = m - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
