You are given an integer **n**. Return the integer formed by placing the **digits** of n in **reverse** order.

Examples:
**Input**: n = 25
**Output**: 52
**Explanation**: Reverse of 25 is 52.

**Input**: n = 123
**Output**: 321
**Explanation**: Reverse of 123 is 321.

Constraints:

- 0 <= n <= 5000
- n will contain no leading zeroes except when it is 0 itself.

## Intuition
1. Initialize a reversed number with zero, which will store the reversed number. To push any digit at the end of the reversed number, the following mathematical operation can be used:  
    `revNum = (revNum * 10) + digit`.
2. The last digit of the original number can be found by using the modulus operator (used to find the remainder for any division) with the number 10.
3. Iterate on the original number till there are digits left. In every iteration, extract the last (rightmost) digit and push it at the back of the reversed number. Also, divide the original number by 10 so that the remaining digits can be extracted in the next iterations.
4. Once the iterations are over, the reversed number will be stored in the reverse of the original number.

### My Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reverseNumber(int n) {
        int rev = 0;
        
        while (n > 0){
	        rev = rev*10 + n%10;
	        n = n/10;
//say the number is 123, this code will take 3 and add it to rev*10
//rev = 3, then it takes 2 and adds to 3*10 = 30 giving 32
//rev = 32; 1%10 = 1; 32*10 + 1 = 321 <-
        }
        return rev;
    }
};
```
