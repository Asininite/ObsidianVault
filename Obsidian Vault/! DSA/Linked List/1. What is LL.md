- arrays are at contiguous locations (consecutive aka memory store 8342, 8343) and are thus easy to traverse
- linked lists are **NOT** in contiguous location and **size** can be increased at any moment
- in heap memory starting point is stored m1 (head) and next is stored at m2

### Where is it Used?
- stack and queue
- always in a browser

```cpp
int n = 2;

int* y = &x;
// you cannot store a memory location
// so you store a pointer to it in form of
// int*

cout << y;
```
