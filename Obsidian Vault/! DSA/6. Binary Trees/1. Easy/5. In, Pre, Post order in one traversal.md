## Intuition

A binary tree's preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals typically require three separate traversals. This can be obtained in a single pass using a stack for state management. The stack tracks the traversal state for each node. In the preorder state, the node's value is recorded, and its left child is pushed onto the stack. In the inorder state, the node's value is recorded, and its right child is pushed onto the stack. In the postorder state, the node's value is recorded, and the node is popped from the stack. This process pushes each value into separate arrays for preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals, enabling a single traversal to compute all three orders.

## Approach

1. Create three vectors to store the results of Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversals. Use a stack to keep track of nodes and their traversal states. Start with the root node and a state of 1 (indicating Preorder).While the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack.
2. If the state is 1 (Preorder), add the node's data to the Preorder vector, change the state to 2 (Inorder) and push the node back onto the stack. If the node has a left child, push it onto the stack with a state of 1.
3. If the state is 2 (Inorder), add the node's data to the Inorder vector. change the state to 3 (Postorder) and push the node back onto the stack. If the node has a right child, push it onto the stack with a state of 1.
4. If the state is 3 (Postorder), Add the
