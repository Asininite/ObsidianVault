Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the **diameter** of the tree.

  

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. It may or may not pass through the root.

Examples:

**Input :** root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**Output :** 3

**Explanation :** The path length between node 4 and 3 is of length 3.

There are other ways to reach the solution.

## Brute Force
### Intuition

To determine the diameter of a binary tree, consider each node as a potential **Curving Point** in the path that forms the diameter. This Curving Point represents the node at the maximum height along the diameter path, where the path transitions between ascending and descending. The diameter at a particular Curving Point is calculated by adding the height of the left subtree to the height of the right subtree. This can be expressed as:

Diameter = Left Subtree Height + Right Subtree Height

### Approach

- Start by initializing a global variable `diameter` to keep track of the maximum diameter encountered during the traversal. This variable will be updated at each node as the tree is traversed.
- Create a recursive function called `calculateHeight` that calculates the height of each node. For each node, compute the height of its left and right subtrees, and use these values to determine the current diameter by summing the heights. Continuously update the `diameter` variable with the maximum value encountered during this process.
- Begin traversing the tree from the root node, utilizing the `calculateHeight` function to compute and update the maximum diameter at each node. Once the traversal is complete, return the value stored in `diameter` as the final result.

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    // Function to compute the height of a subtree
    int height(TreeNode* node) {
        if (node == nullptr) return 0;
        return 1 + max(height(node->left), height(node->right));
    }
public:
    // Function to find the diameter of a binary tree (Brute Force)
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return 0;

        // Get the height of left and right subtrees
        int leftHeight = height(root->left);
        int rightHeight = height(root->right);

        // Calculate diameter through the current node
        int currentDiameter = leftHeight + rightHeight;

        // Recursively calculate the diameter of left and right subtrees
        int leftDiameter = diameterOfBinaryTree(root->left);
        int rightDiameter = diameterOfBinaryTree(root->right);

        // Return the maximum of the three values
        return max(currentDiameter, max(leftDiameter, rightDiameter));
    }
};
