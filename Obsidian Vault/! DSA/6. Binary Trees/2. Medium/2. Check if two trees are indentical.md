iven the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the **same** or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.
Examples:
**Input :** p = [1, 2, 3] , q = [1, 2, 3]
**Output :** true
**Explanation :** Both trees images are shown below

### Approach
- first check whether the heads of the two trees (p and q) are null aka both trees are empty, if so they are identical and return false
- if not check if either one of them is null then return false
- check if the data of the two root nodes is unequal if so return false

- then use recursion and return the same function with the nodes pointing to left and then the nodes pointing to right

```cpp
class Solution{
public:
	bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q){
		if(p == nullptr && q == nullptr){
			return true;
		}
		
		if(p == nullptr || q == nullptr){
			return false;
		}
		
		if(p->data != q->data){
			return false;
		}
		
		return isSameTree(p->left, q->left) && isSameOrder(p->right, q->right);
	}
}
```
