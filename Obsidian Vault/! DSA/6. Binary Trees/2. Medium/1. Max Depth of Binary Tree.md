Examples:

**Input :** root = [1, 2, 3, null, null, null , 6]

**Output :** 3

**Explanation :** The path from root node 1 to node with value 6 has maximum depth with 3 nodes along path.

### Recursive Approach
```cpp
class Solution{
public:
	int maxDepth(TreeNode* root){
		if(root == nullptr){
			return 0;
		}
		int left = maxDepth(root->left);
		int right = maxDepth(root->right);
		return 1 + max(left, right);
	}
};
```
- how this works is if the root is empty then it returns null
- it then selects the left node and puts it in the function recursively as left and vice versa
- if the node doesn't exist then it will return 0, else it will return 1+(the return of the next recursive call)
- in this way, left and right variables both store the depth of the tree
- we then do a simple comparison of the max to get the longest subtree aka the maximum depth

### Iterative Approach
- similar to level order traversal
- we initialize a queue, push the root node to it first, then while the queue isn't empty we keep checking for nodes to the left and right of each node that is in the queue currently and we push that into the queue
- we increment the ans for every time the while loop loops? or resets back since the queue keeps track of all the nodes in each level at a time
```cpp
class Solution{
public:
	int maxDepth(TreeNode* root){
		
	}
};
```
