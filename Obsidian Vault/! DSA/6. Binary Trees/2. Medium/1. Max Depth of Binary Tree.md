Examples:

**Input :** root = [1, 2, 3, null, null, null , 6]

**Output :** 3

**Explanation :** The path from root node 1 to node with value 6 has maximum depth with 3 nodes along path.

### Recursive Approach
```cpp
class Solution{
public:
	int maxDepth(TreeNode* root){
		if(root == nullptr){
			return 0;
		}
		int left = maxDepth(root->left);
		int right = maxDepth(root->right);
		return 1 + max(left, right);
	}
};
```
- how this works is if the root is empty then it returns null
- it then selects the left node and puts it in the function recursively as left and vice versa
- if the node doesn't exist then it will return 0, else it will return 1+(the return of the next recursive call)
- in this way, left and right variables both store the depth of the tree
- we then do a simple comparison of the max to get the longest subtree aka the maximum depth

### Iterative Approach
```cpp
class Solution{
public:
	int maxDepth(TreeNode* root){
		
	}
};
```
