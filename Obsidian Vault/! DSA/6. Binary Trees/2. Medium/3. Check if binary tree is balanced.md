### Brute Approach
## Intuition

The reasoning behind checking if a binary tree is balanced revolves around ensuring that, for every node in the tree, the height difference between the left and right subtrees is no more than one. This condition prevents the tree from being skewed too much to one side, ensuring a balanced structure. By recursively assessing this balance condition at each node, it's possible to determine if the entire tree maintains a balanced state.

## Approach

- First, check if the root node is null. If it is, return `true` because an empty tree is inherently balanced.
- For non-empty trees, recursively calculate the height of both the left and right subtrees using a helper function, often called `getHeight`. Store these heights and compare them. If the absolute difference between the heights is greater than 1, return `false`, as this indicates the tree is unbalanced at the current node.
- If the height difference is 1 or less, proceed by recursively invoking the `isBalanced` function on the left and right child nodes. If both subtrees are found to be balanced, return `true`. If either subtree is unbalanced, return `false`, indicating that the tree overall is not balanced.
- at the end we need to recursively **check the nodes again** because there is a chance the root of the tree might be balanced but a different node in the subtree might not be

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

        // Check if the absolute difference in heights
        // of left and right subtrees is <= 1
        if (std::abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) <= 1 &&
            isBalanced(root->left) &&
            isBalanced(root->right)) {
            return true;
        }

        // If any condition fails, the tree is unbalanced
        return false;

        // Base case: if the current node is NULL,

        // plus 1 (to account for the current node)
