Given a sorted array of nums consisting of distinct integers and a target value, return the **index** if the **target** is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

Examples:

Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 5

Output: 2

Explanation: The target value 5 is found at index 2 in the sorted array. Hence, the function returns 2.

Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: The target value 2 is not found in the array. However, it should be inserted at index 1 to maintain the sorted

### **Approach:** 
1. Use two pointers to traverse the array, low and high, and an ans variable with the size of the array to store the answer. The low pointer starts at the first index, and the high pointer starts at the last index.
2. Calculate the middle index, and compare arr[mid] with the given element. If `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to the given element then we the update the ans variable with mid and search in the left half for a smaller index that also satisfies the condition.
3. If arr[mid] is less than the given element, then we search in the right half by eliminating the left half. We do so by making the low pointer as mid+1.
4. Continue the process until the low pointer crosses the high pointer. At this point, the ans variable will hold the answer.
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution
{
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int> &nums, int target)
    {
        int n = nums.size(); 
        int low = 0, high = n - 1;
        int ans = n;

        // Applying Binary Search Algorithm
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            /* If mid element is greater than 
               or equal to target, update ans 
               and search the left half */
            if (nums[mid] >= target) {
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            }
            // Otherwise, search the right half
            else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

int main()
{
    vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 5, 6};
    int target = 5;

    // Create an instance of the Solution class
    Solution sol;

    // Find the insertion index
    int ind = sol.searchInsert(nums, target);

    cout << "The index is: " << ind << "\n";
    return 0;
}
