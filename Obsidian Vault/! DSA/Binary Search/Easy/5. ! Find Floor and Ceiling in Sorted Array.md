Given a sorted array nums and an integer x. Find the **floor** and **ceil** of x in nums. The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x. The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x. If no floor or ceil exists, output -1.

**Examples**:
Input : nums =[3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10], x= 5
Output: 4 7
Explanation: The floor of 5 in the array is 4, and the ceiling of 5 in the array is 7.

Input : nums =[3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10], x= 8
Output: 8 8
Explanation: The floor of 8 in the array is 8, and the ceiling of 8 in the array is also 8.

### Intuition
- For getting the floor value of x in nums, divide the array in two halves and compare the middle values with x. When x is less than or equal to the middle element, store the middle element as answer and will try to find a larger number that satisfies the same condition.
- From the given statements, we can understand that the ceiling value of x, is basically the lower bound of x.

### Approach
**Find floor**
- Use two pointers, low and high initialized with the first and last indexes which will makr our search space. Use an answer variable initialized with -1 to store the floor value.
- Calculate the middle element, and compare its value as described below :
- When the middle element is less than or equal to the given element, store it as a possible answer and eliminate the left half to look for a greater element in the right part of the array.
- In case the middle element is greater than the given element, eliminate the right half and reduce the search space to left half to look for a smaller element.
- Repeat these steps until the low pointer lesser than or equal to the high pointer.

**Find ceil**
- For calculating the ceil value, follow a similar approach, but compare the values depending upon the below points:
- In this case, store the middle element as a possible answer when the middle elements value is greater than or equal to the given element. Eliminate the right half to look for a smaller element in the left half which satisfies the same condition.
- When the middle element is smaller than the given element, eliminate the left half to search for a larger element in the right half of the given array.

        int ans = -1;

        // Perform binary search to find floor value
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            
            /*Check if mid element lesser than 
			      or equal to x, if it is update ans

                high = mid - 1;
