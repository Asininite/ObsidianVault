**Dereferencing a null pointer** means trying to **access the value** or **members** of a pointer that holds the value `nullptr` (or `NULL` in older C++ code). In simple terms:

> You're trying to use something that doesn't exist.

## 🧠 What is a pointer?

A **pointer** is a variable that holds the **memory address** of another variable.

Example:

```cpp
int x = 10;
int* ptr = &x; // ptr points to x
```

You can **dereference** the pointer using `*ptr` to get the value `10`.

---

## ❌ What is a null pointer?

A **null pointer** is a pointer that **does not point to any valid memory location**. It’s either:

```cpp
int* ptr = nullptr;  // modern C++
int* ptr = NULL;     // older C/C++
```

---

## ❌ Dereferencing a null pointer:

If you write:

```cpp
int* ptr = nullptr;
int y = *ptr;         // 🚨 runtime crash
```

You're trying to access the value at address `0x0` (which is reserved), and this causes a **runtime error**, often a **segmentation fault** or **access violation**.

---

## ❌ Another common example:

```cpp
ListNode* node = nullptr;
int val = node->val;  // ❌ crash: you're accessing a field from a null pointer
```

---

## 💥 What happens at runtime?

The system sees you’re trying to read or write memory at address `0x0` (null), which is:

- Invalid
    
- Protected by the OS
    
- Causes the program to **crash immediately**
    

---

## ✅ How to avoid it:

**Always check** a pointer before dereferencing:

```cpp
if (ptr != nullptr) {
    int val = *ptr;  // safe
}
```

Or for linked list:

```cpp
if (node && node->next) {
    int val = node->next->val;  // safe
}
```

## 🧠 In summary:

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|Null pointer|A pointer that points to nothing (`nullptr`)|
|Dereferencing|Accessing the value or members the pointer points to|
|Dereferencing null pointer|Trying to use a pointer that doesn’t point to anything — causes **runtime crash**|

Let me know if you'd like to see a real example that crashes vs. a fixed version.
