Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to find the starting point of a loop in the linked list if it exists. Return the starting node if a loop exists; otherwise, return null.

A loop exists in a linked list if some node in the list can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos denotes the index (0-based) of the node from where the loop starts.

Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

## Brute
- use hashmap and store the nodes visited
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

// Definition of singly linked list
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(NULL) {}
    ListNode(int data1) : val(data1), next(NULL) {}
    ListNode(int data1, ListNode *next1) : val(data1), next(next1) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the starting point of the loop
    // in a linked list using hashing technique
    ListNode *findStartingPoint(ListNode *head) {
        // Use temp to traverse the linked list
        ListNode* temp = head;

        // hashmap to store all visited nodes
        std::unordered_map<ListNode*, int> mp;

        // Traverse the list using temp
        while(temp != nullptr) {
            // Check if temp has been encountered again
            if(mp.count(temp) != 0) {
                // A loop is detected hence return temp
                return temp;
            }
            // Store temp as visited
            mp[temp] = 1;
            // Move to the next node
            temp = temp->next;
        }

        // If no loop is detected, return nullptr
        return nullptr;
    }
};

// Function to create a linked list with a loop for testing
void createTestList(ListNode* &head, int loop_start_val) {
    ListNode* node1 = new ListNode(1);
    ListNode* node2 = new ListNode(2);
    ListNode* node3 = new ListNode(3);
    ListNode* node4 = new ListNode(4);
    ListNode* node5 = new ListNode(5);

    node1->next = node2;
    node2->next = node3;
    node3->next = node4;
    node4->next = node5;

    head = node1;

    // Create a loop from node5 to the specified node
    ListNode* temp = head;
    while (temp != nullptr && temp->val != loop_start_val) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    node5->next = temp; // Creating the loop
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample linked list with a loop
    ListNode* head = nullptr;
    createTestList(head, 2); // Creating a loop starting at node with value 2

    // Create an instance of the Solution class
    Solution solution;

    // Detect the starting point of the loop in the linked list
    ListNode* loopStartNode = solution.findStartingPoint(head);

    if (loopStartNode) {
        std::cout << "Loop detected. Starting node of the loop is: " << loopStartNode->val << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "No loop detected in the linked list." << std::endl;
    }

    // Clean up memory (free the allocated nodes)
    ListNode* temp = head;
    std::unordered_map<ListNode*, bool> visited;
    while (temp != nullptr && visited[temp] == false) {
        visited[temp] = true;
        ListNode* next = temp->next;
        delete temp;
        temp = next;
    }

    return 0;
}
```


## Best Approach

**Initialization:** Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to the head of the linked list. The `slow` pointer will advance one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer will advance two steps at a time. These pointers will move simultaneously through the list.

**Traversal:** As the traversal progresses, move the `slow` pointer one step and the `fast` pointer two steps at a time. This continues until one of two conditions is met: if `fast` or `fast.next` reaches the end of the linked list (i.e., becomes null), it means there is no loop in the linked list, and the algorithm terminates by returning null. Alternatively, if the `fast` and `slow` pointers meet at the same node, it indicates the presence of a loop in the linked list.

**Finding the Loop's Start:** Once a loop is detected, reset the `slow` pointer to the head of the linked list. Then, move both the `fast` and `slow` pointers one step at a time. The point where they meet again is identified as the starting point of the loop. This method ensures efficient detection and pinpointing of the loop's starting location in the linked list.

  
**Proof of the Approach**

You might wonder how this algorithm works, and it all comes down to the concept that the meeting point of the slow and fast pointers can be used to find the start of the loop.

In the "tortoise and hare" method for detecting loops in a linked list, when the slow pointer (tortoise) reaches the start of the loop, the fast pointer (hare) is at a position that is twice the distance traveled by the slow pointer. This happens because the hare moves twice as fast as the tortoise.

2/2

If the slow pointer has traveled a distance of L1, then the fast pointer has traveled 2 * L1. Now, both pointers are inside the loop, and the distance the fast pointer needs to cover to catch up with the slow pointer is the total length of the loop minus L1. Let's call this distance d.

- Distance traveled by slow = L1
- Distance traveled by fast = 2 * L1
- Total length of loop = L1 + d

In this setup, the fast pointer moves two steps forward while the slow pointer moves one step forward in each iteration. This reduces the gap between them by one step each time. Given that the initial gap is d, it will take exactly d steps for the fast pointer to catch up with the slow pointer.

- Total length of loop = L1 + d
- Distance between slow and fast = d

During these d steps, the slow pointer will move d steps from the start of the loop, and the fast pointer will move 2 * d steps to meet the slow pointer. According to our calculations, the total length of the loop is L1 + d. Since the slow pointer covers a distance of d inside the loop, the remaining distance in the loop equals L1.

Thus, we can see that the distance from the start of the loop to the meeting point is equal to the distance from the start of the linked list to the start of the loop. This proves that the point where the two pointers meet is indeed the start of the loop in the linked list.
