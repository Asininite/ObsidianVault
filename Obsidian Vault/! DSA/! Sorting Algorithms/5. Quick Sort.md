- first set pivot at end
	  we need to find resting place of pivot
- set i = -1 (index before first element)
  set j = 0
```
if(nums[j]>=pivot){
	j++; // just ignore and move to next element
} else { // so j is less than pivot
	i++;
	swap(nums[i], nums[j]);
	j++;
}
```
- this repeats until j reaches pivot, then i++ is the **place of the pivot** 
- now all elements to left of pivot are **less than pivot** and to right are **greater**
- then create two subarrays split using pivot and repeat the same above steps
- we then merge the arrays and this recursively repeats until we get a sorted array
