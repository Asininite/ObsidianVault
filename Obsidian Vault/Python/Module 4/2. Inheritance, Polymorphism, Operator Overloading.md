**1. Data encapsulation.** Restricting the manipulation of an object’s state by external users to a set of method calls.Encapsulation restricts access to an object’s data to users of the methods of its class.This helps to prevent in discriminant changes to an object’s data.

**2. Inheritance.** Allowing a class to automatically reuse and extend the code of similar but more general classes.Inheritance allows one class to pick up the attributes and behavior of another class for free. The subclass may also extend its parent class by adding data and/or methods or modifying the same methods. Inheritance is a major means of reusing code

**3. Polymorphism**. Allowing several different classes to use the same general method names. Polymorphism allows methods in several different classes to have the same headers.This reduces the need to learn new names for standard operations.Function over riding and operator overloading provides Polymorphism.
