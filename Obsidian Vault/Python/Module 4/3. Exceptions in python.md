### syntax errors and logical errors
- code doesn't follow fundamental grammar rules : **syntax error**

```python
try:
    # code that might raise an error
except SomeError:
    # code to run if error occurs
else:
    # runs if no error
finally:
    # always runs (e.g., clean up)

```

```python
try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    y = 10 / x
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a valid number.")
else:
    print("No errors!")
finally:
    print("End of program.")

```

| Exception           | Trigger Situation                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `ZeroDivisionError` | Division by zero                       |
| `ValueError`        | Wrong value (e.g., `int("abc")`)       |
| `TypeError`         | Wrong data type (e.g., add int + str)  |
| `IndexError`        | Index out of range in list             |
| `KeyError`          | Dictionary key not found               |
| `ImportError`       | Module not found                       |
| `FileNotFoundError` | File doesn't exist                     |
| `NameError`         | Variable not defined                   |
| `AttributeError`    | Invalid object method/attribute access |
|                     |                                        |
|                     |                                        |
|                     |                                        |

Okay, let's break down Python's exception handling in detail, based on the provided course material from Dr. Binu V P.

This material covers how Python deals with errors, allowing you to write more robust and user-friendly programs.

**Core Concepts: Errors in Python**

When you're writing and running Python code, you'll inevitably encounter errors. These errors can be broadly categorized into two types:

1.  **Syntax Errors (Parsing Errors):**
    *   These errors occur when your code doesn't follow the fundamental grammatical rules of the Python language.
    *   The Python interpreter catches these errors *before* your program even starts running.
    *   The interpreter will point to where it encountered the problem.
    *   **Example from the text:**
        ```python
        # if a < 3  # Missing colon
        #  File "<interactive input>", line 1
        #    if a < 3
        #          ^
        # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        ```
        In this case, the `if` statement is missing the required colon (`:`) at the end.

2.  **Logical Errors (Exceptions):**
    *   These errors occur *during* the execution of your program, even if the syntax is correct.
    *   They arise when the program encounters an unexpected situation or an operation that it cannot perform.
    *   When a logical error occurs, Python creates an "exception object." If your program doesn't handle this exception, it will terminate and print a "traceback," which shows where the error happened and what type of error it was.

    *   **Examples from the text:**
        *   **`ZeroDivisionError`**: Trying to divide a number by zero.
            ```python
            # >>> 3/0
            # Traceback (most recent call last):
            #   File "<pyshell#0>", line 1, in <module>
            #     3/0
            # ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
            ```
        *   **`FileNotFoundError`**: Trying to open a file that doesn't exist.
            ```python
            # >>> open("abc.txt")
            # Traceback (most recent call last):
            #   File "<pyshell#1>", line 1, in <module>
            #     open("abc.txt")
            # FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'abc.txt'
            ```
        *   **`IndexError`**: Trying to access an element in a list (or other sequence) using an index that is out of bounds.
            ```python
            # >>> a=[10,20]
            # >>> a[2]  # Valid indices are 0 and 1
            # Traceback (most recent call last):
            #   File "<pyshell#3>", line 1, in <module>
            #     a[2]
            # IndexError: list index out of range
            ```

**What is an Exception?**

An exception is an event that occurs during the program's execution that disrupts its normal flow. When Python encounters a situation it can't handle, it "raises" an exception. This exception is essentially an object that represents the error. If this raised exception is not "handled," the program will stop.

**Python's Built-in Exceptions**

Python comes with a wide range of built-in exceptions that cover common error scenarios. You can technically list all built-in exceptions, functions, and attributes using `print(dir(locals()['__builtins__']))`.

Here are some common built-in exceptions mentioned in the text:

*   **`AssertionError`**: Raised when an `assert` statement fails.
*   **`AttributeError`**: Raised when an attribute assignment or reference fails (e.g., trying to access a method or property that doesn't exist on an object).
*   **`EOFError`**: Raised when the `input()` function reaches an end-of-file condition without reading any data.
*   **`ImportError`**: Raised when the `import` statement has trouble trying to load a module.
*   **`IndexError`**: Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.
*   **`KeyError`**: Raised when a mapping (e.g., dictionary) key is not found.
*   **`KeyboardInterrupt`**: Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (usually Ctrl+C or Delete).
*   **`MemoryError`**: Raised when an operation runs out of memory.
*   **`NameError`**: Raised when a local or global name (variable) is not found.
*   **`OSError`**: Raised when a system operation causes a system-related error (like a file not found, disk full, etc.). `FileNotFoundError` is a subclass of `OSError`.
*   **`OverflowError`**: Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented.
*   **`RuntimeError`**: Raised when an error is detected that doesn't fall in any of the other categories.
*   **`SyntaxError`**: Raised by the parser when a syntax error is encountered.
*   **`IndentationError`**: Raised when there is incorrect indentation. (Subclass of `SyntaxError`)
*   **`TabError`**: Raised when indentation consists of inconsistent tabs and spaces. (Subclass of `IndentationError`)
*   **`TypeError`**: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
*   **`ValueError`**: Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.
*   **`ZeroDivisionError`**: Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.

**Handling Exceptions: `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`**

To prevent your program from crashing when an exception occurs, you need to "handle" it. Python provides the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` statements for this purpose.

1.  **The `try` block:**
    *   You place the code that might potentially raise an exception inside the `try` block.

2.  **The `except` block:**
    *   If an exception occurs within the `try` block, Python immediately stops executing the rest of the code in the `try` block and looks for a matching `except` block.
    *   If a matching `except` block is found, the code inside that `except` block is executed.
    *   You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.
    *   You can also have a generic `except` block that catches any exception, but this is generally not recommended as it can hide errors you weren't expecting.

    **Syntax:**
    ```python
    try:
        # Code that might raise an exception
        # ...
    except SpecificExceptionType1:
        # Code to handle SpecificExceptionType1
        # ...
    except SpecificExceptionType2:
        # Code to handle SpecificExceptionType2
        # ...
    except: # Generic exception handler (use with caution)
        # Code to handle any other exception
        # ...
    ```

    **Example (from text, modified for clarity):**
    ```python
    filename = input('Enter a file name: ')
    try:
        f = open(filename, "r")
        content = f.read()
        print("File content:\n", content)
    except FileNotFoundError: # More specific than IOError for this case
        print('There is no file named', filename)
    except PermissionError:
        print('You do not have permission to read the file', filename)
    except Exception as e: # Catch other potential I/O related errors
        print('An error occurred:', e)
    ```

3.  **Accessing the Exception Object:**
    *   You can get access to the exception object itself within an `except` block using `as`.
    *   This is useful for logging the error or displaying more specific error information.

    **Example (from text):**
    ```python
    try:
        x = int(input('Enter x: '))
        y = 1 / x
        print("1/x =", y)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Oops!", e.__class__, "occurred.") # e.__class__ gives the type of exception
        print("Error message:", e)               # e gives the error message
    ```
    If you enter `0`, the output would be something like:
    `Oops! <class 'ZeroDivisionError'> occurred.`
    `Error message: division by zero`

4.  **Catching Multiple Exceptions in a Single Block:**
    *   You can handle multiple specific exception types in a single `except` block by providing them as a tuple.

    **Syntax (from text):**
    ```python
    try:
        # Operations here
        pass
    except (TypeError, ZeroDivisionError):
        # Handle TypeError and ZeroDivisionError
        pass
    ```
    **Example (from text):**
    ```python
    filename = "somefile.txt" # Assume filename is defined
    try:
        f = open(filename, "r")
        # ... process file ...
        f.close()
    except (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError):
        print("File Error: Either the file was not found or permission was denied.")
    ```

5.  **The `else` block (optional):**
    *   The code inside the `else` block is executed *only if* no exceptions are raised in the `try` block.
    *   It's a good place for code that should run only if the `try` block was successful and doesn't need to be protected itself.

    **Syntax (from text):**
    ```python
    try:
        # Operations here
        # ...
    except SomeException:
        # Handle SomeException
        # ...
    else:
        # If there is no exception, then execute this block.
        # ...
    ```
    **Example (from text, combined):**
    ```python
    filename = input('Enter a file name: ')
    try:
        f = open(filename, "r")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print('There is no file named', filename)
    else:
        print(f"File '{filename}' opened successfully. Now reading and closing.")
        content = f.read()
        print("Content snippet:", content[:50] + "...") # Print first 50 chars
        f.close()
        print(f"File '{filename}' closed.")
    ```

6.  **The `finally` block (optional):**
    *   The code inside the `finally` block is *always* executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred in the `try` block or not.
    *   It's typically used for cleanup operations, such as closing files, releasing network connections, or releasing other resources, ensuring these actions happen even if an error occurs.
    *   Note: You can have `try...except...finally`, `try...except...else...finally`, or `try...finally`. The text mentions "You cannot use else clause as well along with a finally clause," which means a `try...else...finally` structure without an `except` block is not valid. However, `try...except...else...finally` is perfectly valid.

    **Syntax (from text):**
    ```python
    try:
        # Operations here
        # ...
        # Due to any exception, this may be skipped.
    finally:
        # This would always be executed.
        # ...
    ```
    **Example (from text, slightly modified for completeness):**
    ```python
    f = None # Initialize f outside try to ensure it's in scope for finally
    try:
        f = open("test.txt", encoding='utf-8')
        # Perform file operations
        data = f.read()
        print("File content:", data)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: test.txt not found.")
    except IOError: # Broader I/O error
        print("An I/O error occurred.")
    finally:
        if f: # Check if the file was successfully opened before trying to close it
            print("Executing finally block: Closing the file.")
            f.close()
    ```

**Order of Execution with `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`:**

1.  The `try` block is executed.
2.  *If an exception occurs:*
    *   The rest of the `try` block is skipped.
    *   Python looks for a matching `except` block.
        *   If found, the `except` block is executed.
        *   If not found, the exception propagates up (and might crash the program if not caught elsewhere).
    *   The `else` block is skipped.
3.  *If no exception occurs:*
    *   The `try` block completes successfully.
    *   The `except` block(s) are skipped.
    *   The `else` block (if present) is executed.
4.  The `finally` block (if present) is always executed after the `try`, `except`, and `else` blocks, regardless of whether an exception occurred or was handled.

**Raising Exceptions Manually (`raise`)**

Sometimes, you might want to explicitly raise an exception in your code if a certain condition is not met, even if it's not an error that Python would automatically detect. The `raise` keyword is used for this.

*   You can raise built-in exceptions or custom exceptions (see next section).
*   You can optionally pass an argument to the exception, which is usually a string message explaining the reason for the exception.

**Syntax:**
```python
raise ExceptionName
raise ExceptionName("Descriptive message about the error")
```

**Examples (from text):**
```python
>>> raise KeyboardInterrupt
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
KeyboardInterrupt

>>> raise MemoryError("This is an argument explaining the memory error")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
MemoryError: This is an argument explaining the memory error
```

**Practical Example of `raise` (from text):**
```python
try:
    a = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
    if a <= 0:
        raise ValueError("That is not a positive number!") # Manually raising ValueError
    print(f"You entered {a}, which is a positive number.")
except ValueError as ve: # Catches both int() conversion errors and our raised error
    print(ve)

 Test cases:
 Enter a positive integer: 5
 Output: You entered 5, which is a positive number.

 Enter a positive integer: -2
 Output: That is not a positive number!

# Enter a positive integer: abc
# Output: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
```

**Custom Exceptions**

Python allows you to create your own custom exception types by defining a new class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class (or one of its subclasses). This is useful for creating more specific and meaningful error handling in your applications.

**Benefits of Custom Exceptions:**
*   **Clarity:** Makes your code easier to read and understand, as you can define exceptions that are specific to your application's domain.
*   **Granular Handling:** Allows you to catch and handle your specific error conditions differently from built-in exceptions.
*   **Information:** You can add custom attributes and methods to your exception classes to carry more information about the error.

**How to Create a Custom Exception (from text):**
```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    """Custom exception class."""
    def __init__(self, message="A custom error occurred."):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message) # Call the base class constructor

# Example of using the custom exception
def example_function(value):
    if value < 0:
        raise CustomError("Negative values are not allowed by example_function.")

# Using the custom exception in your code
try:
    user_input_str = input("Enter a positive number for example_function: ")
    user_input = int(user_input_str)
    example_function(user_input)
    print(f"example_function processed {user_input} successfully.")
except CustomError as ce:
    print(f"CustomError caught: {ce}")
except ValueError:
    print(f"Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer number. You entered: '{user_input_str}'")
```

**Example: Voting Eligibility with Custom Exceptions (from text):**
This example demonstrates creating custom exceptions for specific validation failures.

```python
class InvalidAgeError(Exception): # Renamed for clarity, inheriting from Exception
    """Custom exception for invalid age."""
    def __init__(self, message="Age cannot be below 18."):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)
    # The display method is not standard, usually the message is enough.
    # def display(self):
    #     print(self.message)

class InvalidNameError(Exception): # Renamed for clarity
    """Custom exception for invalid name."""
    def __init__(self, message="Please enter a valid name (cannot be empty)."):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)
    # def display(self):
    #     print(self.message)

try:
    name = input("Enter the Name: ")
    if len(name.strip()) == 0: # .strip() removes leading/trailing whitespace
        raise InvalidNameError()

    age_str = input("Enter the Age: ")
    if not age_str.isdigit():
        raise ValueError("Age must be a number.") # Standard ValueError for type issues
    age = int(age_str)

    if age < 18:
        raise InvalidAgeError() # Raise custom error for age rule

except InvalidNameError as ine:
    print(f"Error: {ine}") # Access the message via the exception object
except InvalidAgeError as iae:
    print(f"Error: {iae}")
except ValueError as ve:
    print(f"Input Error: {ve}")
else:
    print(f"{name}, congratulations! You can vote.")
```

**Practical Example: Largest and Smallest Number (University Question from text)**

This program demonstrates robust input handling using `try-except`.

```python
largest = None
smallest = None

while True:
    user_input = input("Enter an integer number (or 'done' to finish): ")

    if user_input.lower() == 'done':
        break

    try:
        num = int(user_input) # Potential ValueError if input is not a valid integer
        if largest is None or num > largest:
            largest = num
        if smallest is None or num < smallest:
            smallest = num
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer or 'done'.")

if largest is not None and smallest is not None: # Check if any numbers were entered
    print("Largest number:", largest)
    print("Smallest number:", smallest)
else:
    print("No valid numbers were entered.")
```

This detailed explanation covers all the key concepts of exception handling presented in your course material. By understanding and using these constructs, you can write Python programs that are more resilient to errors and provide better feedback to users when things go wrong.
