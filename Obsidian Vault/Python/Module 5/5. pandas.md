- fast and efficient
- data from different file objects can be loaded
- easy handling of missing data
- size mutability : columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects
- data set merging and joining
- flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets

### Series Data structure
- one-dimensional labelled array that can hold data of any type(integers, strings, float) 
- similar to column
- two parts : data and index

```python
import pandas as pd
obj = pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5])
print(obj)

>>>0    1
>>>1    2
>>>2    3
>>>3    4
>>>4    5
>>>dtype: int64
```
