Okay, let's explore Python's basic data types—specifically numbers and strings—and how to convert between types, based on Dr. Binu V P's notes. This is foundational to working with data in Python.

**Core Concept: Everything is an Object**

A crucial idea in Python is that **every value is an object**. This means:
*   **Data types are actually classes:** When we talk about an "integer" or a "string," these are technically `int` and `str` classes.
*   **Variables are instances (objects) of these classes:** When you create a variable like `age = 30`, `age` becomes an instance of the `int` class.

This object-oriented nature gives Python a lot of consistency and power.

**Python Numbers**

Python supports several types of numbers:

1.  **Integers (`int`)**
    *   These are whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
    *   **Unlimited Length:** Integers in Python can be arbitrarily large, limited only by the computer's available memory. You don't have to worry about overflow errors for very large integers like in some other languages.
    *   **Examples:** `10`, `100`, `-786`, `0`
    *   **Representations:**
        *   **Decimal (base 10):** The standard way we write numbers (e.g., `12`).
        *   **Binary (base 2):** Use the prefix `0b` or `0B`.
            ```python
            x = 0b1100  # Binary for 12
            print(x)    # Output: 12
            ```
        *   **Octal (base 8):** Use the prefix `0o` or `0O`.
            ```python
            x = 0o14    # Octal for 12 (1*8 + 4*1)
            print(x)    # Output: 12 (as per text example, 0o12 is 10 in decimal)
            # Let's use the text's example:
            x = 0o12    # Octal for 10 (1*8 + 2*1)
            print(x)    # Output: 10
            ```
        *   **Hexadecimal (base 16):** Use the prefix `0x` or `0X`.
            ```python
            x = 0xc     # Hexadecimal for 12
            print(x)    # Output: 12
            ```

2.  **Floating-Point Numbers (`float`)**
    *   These are numbers with a decimal point, or numbers in exponential (scientific) notation.
    *   **Accuracy:** They are accurate up to approximately 15 decimal places. Beyond that, you might see some rounding or truncation due to how computers store floating-point numbers.
        ```python
        b = 0.1234567890123456789
        print(b)  # Output: 0.12345678901234568 (truncated/rounded)
        ```
    *   **Distinction:** `1` is an integer, but `1.0` is a floating-point number.
    *   **Examples:** `0.0`, `3.14`, `15.20`, `-21.9`, `32.3e18` (which is 32.3 x 10<sup>18</sup>), `70.2E-12` (70.2 x 10<sup>-12</sup>)

3.  **Complex Numbers (`complex`)**
    *   These are numbers with a real part and an imaginary part, written in the form `x + yj` (or `x + yJ`), where `x` is the real part and `y` is the imaginary part.
    *   **Examples:** `3+2j`, `45.j` (real part is 0), `9.322e-36j`, `.876j`, `3e+26J`, `4.53e-7j`

**Utility Functions for Numbers:**

*   **`type()` Function:** Used to determine the class (i.e., data type) of a variable or a value.
    ```python
    a = 5
    b = 4.5
    c = 3 + 2j

    print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'int'>
    print(type(b))  # Output: <class 'float'>
    print(type(c))  # Output: <class 'complex'>
    ```

*   **`isinstance()` Function:** Used to check if an object (variable) is an instance of a particular class. It returns `True` or `False`.
    ```python
    a = 5
    print(isinstance(a, int))    # Output: True
    print(isinstance(a, float))  # Output: False
    ```

*   **`del` Statement:** Used to delete a reference (variable name) to an object. If no other references to that object exist, Python's garbage collector may then free up the memory occupied by the object.
    ```python
    a = 5
    print(a)  # Output: 5
    del a
    # print(a)  # This would now cause a NameError: name 'a' is not defined
    ```

**Python Strings (`str`)**

*   **Definition:** A string is a sequence of Unicode characters. Unicode allows you to represent characters from almost all writing systems in the world.
*   **Representation:**
    *   **Single Quotes:** `s = 'Hello'`
    *   **Double Quotes:** `s = "World"` (Functionally the same as single quotes; useful if your string itself contains a single quote, e.g., `"He's here"`).
    *   **Triple Quotes (`'''` or `"""`):** Used for multi-line strings or for strings that need to contain both single and double quotes without excessive escaping.
        ```python
        s1 = '''A multiline
        string example'''
        print(s1)
        # Output:
        # A multiline
        #         string example

        s2 = """Another "multiline" string with 'quotes'."""
        print(s2)
        # Output: Another "multiline" string with 'quotes'.
        ```

*   **Immutability:** Strings are **immutable**. This means that once a string is created, the characters within it cannot be changed.
    ```python
    S = "Python"
    S[2] = 'd'  # This will raise a TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
    ```
    If you need to "modify" a string, you are actually creating a new string.

*   **Slicing (`[]`):** You can extract a portion of a string (a substring) or individual characters using the slicing operator.
    *   Indices start at 0.
    *   `S[start:end]` extracts characters from index `start` up to (but not including) index `end`.
    ```python
    S = "Python"
    print(S[0])      # Output: P (first character)
    print(S[2:5])    # Output: tho (characters at index 2, 3, 4)
    print(S[:3])     # Output: Pyt (from the beginning up to index 2)
    print(S[3:])     # Output: hon (from index 3 to the end)
    print(S[-1])     # Output: n (last character)
    ```

*   **String Repetition (`*`):** You can repeat a string by multiplying it with an integer.
    ```python
    S = "Python"
    print(S * 2)   # Output: PythonPython
    ```
    *(Note: The text mentions "More about strings and string functions will be discussed later," which is typical as strings have many useful built-in methods.)*

**Boolean Data Type (`bool`)**

*   **Definition:** The boolean data type represents one of two values: `True` or `False`. Booleans are fundamental for logical operations and control flow (e.g., `if` statements).
*   **Keywords:** In Python, boolean values are defined by the keywords `True` and `False`.
*   **Case Sensitivity:** These keywords are case-sensitive. `True` and `False` must start with an uppercase letter.
    ```python
    a = True
    print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'bool'>

    b = False
    print(type(b))  # Output: <class 'bool'>

    # c = true  # This would cause a NameError: name 'true' is not defined
    ```
*   Under the hood, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`.

**None Type (`NoneType`)**

*   **Definition:** `None` is a special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value.
*   It has its own data type, `NoneType`.
*   It's often used to indicate that a variable doesn't have a meaningful value yet, or a function doesn't explicitly return anything.
    ```python
    x = None
    print(x)        # Output: None
    print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'NoneType'>
    ```

**Conversion Between Data Types (Type Casting)**

Python allows you to convert values from one data type to another using built-in functions. This is called type conversion or type casting.

1.  **`int(value)`:** Converts `value` to an integer.
    *   From float: Truncates the decimal part (cuts it off, doesn't round in the mathematical sense of nearest).
        ```python
        print(int(10.6))    # Output: 10
        print(int(-10.6))   # Output: -10
        ```
    *   From string: The string must represent a whole number.
        ```python
        print(int("123"))   # Output: 123
        # print(int("10.5"))  # ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10.5'
        # print(int("1p"))    # ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1p'
        ```

2.  **`float(value)`:** Converts `value` to a floating-point number.
    *   From integer: Adds a decimal part (`.0`).
        ```python
        print(float(5))     # Output: 5.0
        ```
    *   From string: The string must represent a valid number (integer or float).
        ```python
        print(float("2.5"))   # Output: 2.5
        print(float("10"))    # Output: 10.0
        # print(float("abc")) # ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'abc'
        ```

3.  **`str(value)`:** Converts `value` to a string.
    ```python
    print(str(25))      # Output: '25'
    print(str(3.14))    # Output: '3.14'
    print(str(True))    # Output: 'True'
    ```

4.  **`round(number, ndigits=None)`:** Rounds a floating-point `number`.
    *   If `ndigits` is omitted or `None`, it rounds to the nearest integer. For .5 cases, it rounds to the nearest even integer (e.g., `round(2.5)` is `2`, `round(3.5)` is `4`).
    *   If `ndigits` is specified, it rounds to that many decimal places.
        ```python
        print(round(10.6))    # Output: 11
        print(round(10.4))    # Output: 10
        print(round(10.5))    # Output: 10 (rounds to nearest even integer)
        print(round(11.5))    # Output: 12 (rounds to nearest even integer)
        print(round(3.14159, 2)) # Output: 3.14
        ```

5.  **`chr(integer)`:** Converts an integer (representing a Unicode code point) to its corresponding character.
    ```python
    print(chr(65))    # Output: 'A' (Unicode for 'A' is 65)
    print(chr(97))    # Output: 'a'
    ```

6.  **`ord(character)`:** Converts a single character to its integer Unicode code point.
    ```python
    print(ord('A'))   # Output: 65
    print(ord('a'))   # Output: 97
    ```

7.  **`bin(integer)`:** Converts an integer to its binary string representation (prefixed with `0b`).
    ```python
    print(bin(12))    # Output: '0b1100'
    ```

8.  **`oct(integer)`:** Converts an integer to its octal string representation (prefixed with `0o`).
    ```python
    print(oct(12))    # Output: '0o14'
    ```

9.  **`hex(integer)`:** Converts an integer to its hexadecimal string representation (prefixed with `0x`).
    ```python
    print(hex(12))    # Output: '0xc'
    ```

10. **`bool(value)`:** Converts a `value` to a boolean (`True` or `False`).
    *   **Numbers:**
        *   `0` (integer), `0.0` (float), `0+0j` (complex) convert to `False`.
        *   Any other non-zero number (positive or negative) converts to `True`.
            ```python
            zero_int = 0
            print(bool(zero_int))  # Output: False

            pos_int = 1
            print(bool(pos_int))   # Output: True

            neg_flt = -5.1
            print(bool(neg_flt))   # Output: True
            ```
    *   **Sequences (like strings, lists):**
        *   Empty sequences (e.g., `""`, `[]`) convert to `False`.
        *   Non-empty sequences convert to `True`.
    *   **`None`:** Converts to `False`.

**Type Coercion (Implicit Type Conversion)**

*   The text refers to "type coercion" and mentions it in the context of "old version 2.x".
*   In Python, when you perform operations with mixed numeric types, Python often automatically (implicitly) converts one of the operands to the "wider" or more general type.
*   **Example from the text:**
    ```python
    minute = 59
    # In Python 2, minute / 60 would be integer division, resulting in 0.
    # To get float division:
    print(float(minute) / 60)     # Explicit conversion: 0.9833333333333333
    print(minute / 60.0)          # Implicit coercion: 0.9833333333333333
                                  # (minute is coerced to float because 60.0 is float)
    ```
*   **In Python 3:**
    *   The `/` operator *always* performs float division. So, `59 / 60` would directly result in `0.9833333333333333`.
    *   For integer division (discarding the remainder), Python 3 uses the `//` operator: `59 // 60` results in `0`.
    *   However, the principle of type promotion still exists. For example, `10 + 5.5` (int + float) will result in a float (`15.5`). Python promotes the integer to a float before the addition.

Understanding these basic data types and how to convert between them is absolutely essential for any Python programming, especially in data-centric fields like Machine Learning where you'll constantly be working with numbers and text.
