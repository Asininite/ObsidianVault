- external device interrupts CPU at interrupt pin (NMI (**non-maskable**) or INTR for **8086**)
- CPU completes execution of current instruction
- IP incremented to point to next instruction
- CPU ackowledges interrupt on INTA (there is a line above INTA) pin immediately if it is NMI, TRAP or DIVIDE-BY-ZERO interrupt (**independent of IF flag**)
- If INT interrupt, CPU checks IF flag. If set, interrupt acknowledged using INTA pin. If not set, interrupts are ignored
- CPU computes vector address
