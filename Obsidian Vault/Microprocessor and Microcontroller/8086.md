**1. Bus Interface Unit (BIU): The Master of Logistics**

The BIU's job is to handle all the data transfers between the 8086 and the outside world (memory and peripherals). Its clever design enables prefetching of instructions, so the processor is always ahead of the game:

- **Responsibilities:**
    
    - Fetches instructions from memory ahead of time (instruction prefetching).
        
    - Calculates 20-bit physical memory addresses for data access.
        
    - Transfers data between the CPU and memory or I/O ports.
        
    - Manages the 6-byte instruction queue (FIFO).
        
- **Components:**
    
    - **Segment Registers (CS, DS, SS, ES):**
        
        - Hold the starting (base) addresses of four important memory segments:
            
            - **CS (Code Segment):** Contains the program's instructions.
                
            - **DS (Data Segment):** Stores the program's data.
                
            - **SS (Stack Segment):** Holds the stack for temporary storage, subroutine calls, etc.
                
            - **ES (Extra Segment):** Provides additional space, used as a destination for some string operations, offers flexibility in memory management.
                
        - Segments divide the 1MB memory space into 64KB chunks, each with its own starting address.
            
    - **Instruction Pointer (IP):**
        
        - Holds the 16-bit offset (location within the code segment) of the next instruction to be fetched and executed. Works along with CS.
            
    - **Address Adder:**
        
        - Adds the segment register value (shifted 4 bits left - multiplied by 16) and the offset address (IP, SP, BP, or a specific value) to create the full 20-bit physical address for memory or I/O access.
            
    - **Instruction Queue:**
        
        - Holds 6 bytes worth of instructions prefetched from memory, so the EU has a constant supply. This pipelining improves execution speed significantly.
            
    - **Bus Control Logic:**
        
        - Generates control signals that orchestrate memory/I/O operations. Important ones:
            
            - **ALE (Address Latch Enable):** Separates addresses from data on the shared bus lines AD0-AD15.
                
            - **DEN (Data Enable):** Enables external buffers.
                
            - **DT/R (Data Transmit/Receive):** Sets the direction of data flow on the data bus (from/to CPU).
                
            - **M/IO (Memory/IO):** Distinguishes between memory access and I/O access.
                
            - **RD (Read):** Signals a read from memory or an I/O port.
                
            - **WR (Write):** Signals a write to memory or an I/O port.
                

**2. Execution Unit (EU): The Workhorse of Processing**

The EU's main job is to decode and execute the instructions fetched by the BIU. It includes the arithmetic and logical processing units, registers for calculation, and flags to indicate the state of operations:

- **Responsibilities:**
    
    - Decodes instructions from the instruction queue.
        
    - Executes instructions using its internal components (ALU, registers, flags).
        
- **Components:**
    
    - **General Purpose Registers:**
        
        - **AX (Accumulator):** Involved in arithmetic and logic operations, has high (AH) and low (AL) 8-bit parts.
            
        - **BX (Base):** Used for memory addressing (pointers) and in some calculations. Has BH and BL.
            
        - **CX (Count):** Primarily for loop counters, with CH and CL parts.
            
        - **DX (Data):** Handles data transfers, I/O addressing, and acts as an extra register in multiplication/division. Can access DH and DL individually.
            
    - **Index Registers:**
        
        - **SI (Source Index):** Points to the source operand for string operations.
            
        - **DI (Destination Index):** Points to the destination operand for string operations.
            
    - **Stack Pointer (SP):**
        
        - Points to the current top of the stack in memory, which grows downwards. Used for pushing/popping data, local variables, function return addresses.
            
    - **Base Pointer (BP):**
        
        - Generally used as a pointer to data structures on the stack, often for accessing parameters passed to subroutines (functions).
            
    - **Flag Register:**
        
        - 16 bits that represent various status flags:
            
            - **CF (Carry Flag):** Set on carry/borrow for arithmetic operations.
                
            - **PF (Parity Flag):** Set if the number of 1s in the result's low byte is even.
                
            - **AF (Auxiliary Carry Flag):** Used for BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) operations, indicates a carry between nibbles.
                
            - **ZF (Zero Flag):** Set if the result of an operation is zero.
                
            - **SF (Sign Flag):** Reflects the sign of the result, 0=positive, 1=negative (MSB of the result).
                
            - **TF (Trap Flag):** Enables single-step execution (useful for debugging).
                
            - **IF (Interrupt Flag):** Enables/disables hardware interrupts.
                
            - **DF (Direction Flag):** Controls direction of string operations (incrementing/decrementing memory addresses).
                
            - **OF (Overflow Flag):** Set if an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the representable range (too large or too small).
                
    - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):**
        
        - Performs the arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and logic (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) calculations.
            
    - **Control Unit:**
        
        - Responsible for managing all internal sequencing within the EU - instruction decoding, operand fetching, flag manipulation, directing the ALU, timing, and overall instruction execution flow.
            

**Example of How the BIU and EU Work Together**

1. **BIU's Role:** The BIU prefetches the ADD AX, BX instruction from memory. The instruction and following bytes are stored in the instruction queue.
    
2. **EU's Role:** The EU takes the ADD AX, BX instruction from the queue, decodes it (figures out the operation, ADD, and operands, AX, BX).
    
3. **Simultaneous Work:** At the same time, the BIU is busy prefetching the next instruction, getting a head start.
    
4. **Execution:** The EU sends the content of the registers AX and BX to the ALU.
    
5. **Calculation and Flags:** The ALU adds the values, the result is stored back in the AX register, and the flags in the Flag register are set appropriately (like ZF, CF, and SF) based on the result.
    

**Key Benefits of this Architecture**

- **Memory Expansion:** The segmented memory model enabled access to more memory, crucial for the development of larger, more complex programs.
    
- **Improved Performance:** Pipelining with the instruction queue keeps the EU almost constantly busy, leading to significant speed increases over earlier microprocessors.
    
- **Future Compatibility:** The segmented model and two-unit design in the 8086 laid the groundwork for concepts used in all subsequent x86 processors, enabling future generations to run older software.
