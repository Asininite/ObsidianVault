### Modes
- BSR ( Bit Set-Reset)
	  only for port C to set/reset individual bits
	  ![[Pasted image 20241101110115.png]]
- Mode 0 : simple I/O
	  port A and B 8 bit ports
	  port C 4 bit port
- Mode 1 : Handshake I/O or Strobed I/O
	  port A and B 8 bit I/O ports
	  three lines taken from port C as HANDSHAKE signals
	  I/Os are latched
- Mode 2 : Bidirectional I/O or Strobed Bidirection I/O
	  port A as bidirectional port
	  port B either in mode 0 or 1
