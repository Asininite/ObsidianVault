### microcontroller
-  heart of an embedded system
- small computer on single integrated circuit
- memory and I/O components are present and connected internally
- less complex circuits used for specific tasks
- compact and efficient
- used within a compact system 
- used in A/Cs and Refrigerators
- eg : 8051, PIC
### microprocessor
- hear of a computer system
- processor where memory and I/O is connected externally
- complex due to external connection but used for common tasks
- can't be used in compact systems
- not as efficient
- much more powerful
- used in computers eg : intel core i5, Ryzen 7 7800X
