**Key Features:**

- **8-bit Processing:** It handles data in 8-bit chunks.
- **64KB Memory Addressing:** Can directly address up to 64 kilobytes of memory.
- **Single +5V Power Supply:** Simplifies power requirements.
- **3MHz Clock Speed:** Determines the execution speed of instructions.
- **Instruction Set Compatibility:** Upward compatible with its predecessor, the 8080A. This means it can execute all 8080A instructions plus some new ones.
- **Multiplexed Address/Data Bus:** Shares some pins for both address and data, requiring demultiplexing circuitry.

**Architecture:**
The 8085's internal architecture consists of several key components:

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performs arithmetic and logical operations (addition, subtraction, AND, OR, etc.). It has an accumulator to store results and uses flags to indicate status after an operation (e.g., zero result, carry).
    
- **Timing and Control Unit:** Synchronizes the processor's operations with the clock signal and generates control signals for communication with other components.
    
- **Instruction Register and Decoder:** Fetched instructions are stored in the instruction register. The decoder interprets the instruction and determines the sequence of steps for execution.
    
- **Register Array:** A set of registers that store data and addresses temporarily. The 8085 has:
    
    - Accumulator (A): The primary register for arithmetic and logic results.
        
    - General Purpose Registers (B, C, D, E, H, L): Can be used individually or as 16-bit register pairs (BC, DE, HL)
        
    - Stack Pointer (SP): Points to the top of the stack, a memory area used for temporary data storage (especially during subroutine calls).
        
    - Program Counter (PC): Holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched.
        

**Pin Diagram and Signals:**

- **Address Bus (A15 - A8):** Eight lines carry the upper part of the memory address.
    
- **Multiplexed Address/Data Bus (AD7- AD0):** Share pins for the lower address bits and data. A latch and the Address Latch Enable (ALE) signal are used to separate them.
  
#### Interrupts and Externally Initiated Operations

Five interrupt signals
- INTR : Interrupt request
- INTA : interrupt acknowledge
- RESET : 
- HOLD : accept externally initiated signals as inputs
- READY

- **Control and Status Signals:**
    - **RD (Read):** Indicates a memory or I/O read operation (active low).
    
    - **ALE** : Indicates bits on AD7 - AD0 are address bits. (positive going pulse generated every time 8085 begins operation)
	
    - **WR (Write):** Indicates a memory or I/O write operation (active low).
       
    - **IO/M:** Status signal that Distinguishes between memory operations (low) and I/O operations (high).
      Combined with RD and WR to generate I/O and control signals
       
    - **S1, S0:** Status signals that provide additional information about the current operation.
       
#### Power Supply and Clock Frequency

Vcc : +5 power supply
Vss : ground reference
X1 and X2 : for frequency. Crystal connected here and gets divided by 2, so for 3Mhz 6Mhz crystal is used
CLK(OUT) - Clock Output : used as system clock for devices

**Bus Timings:**

8085 operations are synchronized with the system clock. A basic bus operation cycle consists of multiple clock periods (T1, T2, T3, T4). During T1, the address is placed on the address bus and ALE is high to latch it. The control signals and data transfer occur during the later periods (T2 - T4).

**Important Concepts:**

- **Demultiplexing the Bus:** Because the lower address bits are multiplexed with the data bus, you need additional circuitry to separate them using a latch and the ALE signal.
    
- **Memory Interfacing:** Memory chips are connected to the 8085 to store instructions and data. Understanding the memory map (how memory is organized) and addressing schemes is essential.
    
- **I/O Interfacing:** I/O devices are connected to interact with the outside world (keyboards, displays, sensors, etc.). The 8085 provides specific I/O instructions and control signals.
    
- **Interrupts:** External events can interrupt the normal execution flow. The 8085 has five interrupt signals, allowing peripherals to request the CPU's attention.
