In the early days of computing, programs were often loaded into a fixed memory location. This approach had significant drawbacks:

- **Limited Memory Utilization:** Only one program could reside in memory at a time, wasting potentially large chunks of memory.
    
- **Address Conflicts:** Loading multiple programs simultaneously was impossible if their code or data overlapped in memory.
    
- **Lack of Flexibility:** Programs were tied to specific memory addresses, making it difficult to move or share them.
