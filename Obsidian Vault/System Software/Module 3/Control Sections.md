- Control sections are segments of code or data that are treated as independent units by the assembler and linker. 
- They are particularly important when dealing with programs that consist of multiple modules or libraries that are assembled or compiled separately. 
- Control sections provide a mechanism for organizing and linking these separate pieces into a single executable program.

- modular programming
- code reusability
- library management
- code relocation
