**2. Generation of Unique Labels:**

Within a macro, using the same label multiple times would lead to duplicate symbol errors during assembly. Machine-independent macro processors solve this by providing a way to generate unique labels within each macro expansion. This is often done using a special character (e.g.,Â $) that the macro processor replaces with a unique sequence of characters during expansion.
