In Java, instance variables are members of a class that are associated with individual objects (instances) of that class. They are declared within the class but outside of any method, constructor, or block.

- **Belong to an Object:** 
    Each object created from a class has its own distinct copy of the instance variables. Changes to an instance variable in one object do not affect the same instance variable in other objects of the same class.
- **Declaration:**
    They are declared directly inside the class definition, but not within any specific method.
- **Lifetime:**
    Instance variables are created when an object of the class is instantiated using the `new` keyword and are destroyed when the object is garbage collected. 
- **Scope:**
    They are accessible throughout the class, including all non-static methods, constructors, and instance blocks.
- **Default Values:**
    If not explicitly initialized, instance variables receive default values based on their data type (e.g., `0` for numeric types, `false` for booleans, `null` for object references).
- **Access Modifiers:**
    They can have access modifiers (like `public`, `private`, `protected`, or default) to control their visibility and accessibility from other classes.

```java
class Car {
    String brand;  // Instance variable
    String model;  // Instance variable
    int year;      // Instance variable

    public Car(String brand, String model, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand + ", Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020); // Creating an instance
        Car car2 = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022);  // Creating another instance

        car1.displayDetails(); // Accessing instance variables of car1
        car2.displayDetails(); // Accessing instance variables of car2
    }
}
```
