A **process** is a program in execution. It is an active entity that takes up system resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices to perform tasks. Every process has a unique Process Control Block (PCB) that stores information about the process. Processes are a fundamental concept in operating systems, allowing multitasking and efficient use of system resources.  
  
**Real-Life Analogy:** Think of a process as a cooking recipe being executed in a kitchen:

1. The recipe itself (program) is static, but when a chef (CPU) starts preparing it with ingredients (resources), it becomes a process.
2. Each recipe step (instructions) requires specific resources, like pots and ingredients, and must be executed in the right order.

## Process in Memory

Whenever a user double-clicks an icon representing an executable file (program), the program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process. This running process stored in the memory consists of several parts:

1. **Text Segment:** Contains the executable code or instructions.
2. **Data Segment:** Contains global and static variables.
3. **Heap:** Used for dynamic memory allocation during runtime.
4. **Stack:** Used for local variables, function calls, and return addresses.

### Creation of Process

When a program is launched, the OS:

1. Loads the program into the main memory forming a process.
2. Creates a unique Process Control Block (PCB) for the process.
3. Assigns a unique Process ID (PID).

The PCB contains details like the process state, program counter, registers, and allocated resources.

# Process States

A process transitions between different states during its lifecycle. These states help the operating system manage processes efficiently. Below are the key states of a process:

1. **New:**
    - A process is in the "new" state when it is being created.
    - The OS has allocated a PCB, but the process is not yet ready to execute.
2. **Ready:**
    - The process is loaded into memory and is waiting to be assigned CPU time.
    - This state is achieved after the process is initialized and deemed ready to run.
    - Processes in the "ready" state are managed in a queue, often using scheduling algorithms like First-Come-First-Serve or Round Robin.
3. **Running:**
    - The process is being executed by the CPU.
    - A process enters this state when the scheduler assigns CPU time to it.
    - Only one process can be in the running state on a single-core CPU, but multiple processes can run simultaneously on multi-core CPUs.
4. **Waiting (Blocked):**
    - The process is waiting for an I/O operation or some other event to complete.
    - This state is achieved when the process requests a resource that is not currently available.
    - Once the event is completed, the process transitions back to the "ready" state.
5. **Suspended (Swapped):**
    - The process is paused temporarily, either by the user or the operating system, often to free up resources.
    - The process may be swapped out to disk, making room for other processes.
6. **Terminated:**
    - The process has completed its execution and is terminated.
    - Its resources are released, and its PCB is deleted by the OS.
    - This state is reached after the process finishes all its instructions or is explicitly terminated.

### State Transitions

Processes transition between states based on specific events:

- **New → Ready:** Process creation is complete, and it is ready to run.
- **Ready → Running:** The scheduler assigns CPU time to the process.
- **Running → Waiting:** The process requests I/O or other resources.
- **Running → Ready:** Process is preempted(stopped temporarily) by the scheduler (e.g., time slice ends).
- **Waiting → Ready:** The I/O operation is completed or the resource becomes available, and the process is ready to execute again.
- **Running → Terminated:** The process completes its execution or is killed.
- **Ready/Waiting → Suspended:** The process is paused while ready for execution/waiting for an event and swapped to disk.
- **Suspended → Ready/Waiting:** The process is brought back to memory as it is ready for execution/close to completion.

### Advantages of Managing Process States

1. Efficient CPU utilization by prioritizing ready and running processes.
2. Allows multitasking and resource sharing between processes.
3. Improves system responsiveness by managing waiting processes effectively.

###### Example:

A video player application running on a computer:

- The main video decoding process runs on the CPU ("running" state).
- When the player fetches a file from the disk, it waits for I/O ("waiting" state).
- After the file is loaded, the process transitions back to "ready" and resumes playback.
