```cpp
if (fork() == 0)
  { a = a + 5; printf("%d,%d\\n", a, &a); }
  else { a = a –5; printf("%d, %d\\n", a, &a); } 

```
u v are values returned by parent process and x y are returned by child. Are they the same?

fork() returns 0 in child process and process ID of child process in parent process. In Child (x), a = a + 5 In Parent (u), a = a – 5; Therefore x = u + 10. The physical addresses of ‘a’ in parent and child must be different. But our program accesses virtual addresses (assuming we are running on an OS that uses virtual memory). The child process gets an exact copy of parent process and virtual address of ‘a’ doesn’t change in child process. Therefore, we get same addresses in both parent and child. See [this](http://ideone.com/ckhWR) run for example.

 - A shared variable x, initialized to zero, is operated on by four concurrent processes W, X, Y, Z as follows. Each of the processes W and X reads x from memory, increments by one, stores it to memory, and then terminates. Each of the processes Y and Z reads x from memory, decrements by two, stores it to memory, and then terminates. Each process before reading x invokes the P operation (i.e., wait) on a counting semaphore S and invokes the V operation (i.e., signal) on the semaphore S after storing x to memory. Semaphore S is initialized to two. What is the maximum possible value of x after all processes complete execution? (GATE CS 2013)
