## Introduction

In operating systems, threads are the smallest units of execution. They allow concurrent tasks within a single process. By splitting a program into multiple threads, you can run parts of the program concurrently, improving performance, especially on systems with multiple processors or CPU cores. However, there are different ways to implement these threads, leading to two major models:

- User-Level Threads (ULTs)
- Kernel-Level Threads (KLTs)

## User-Level Threads

User-Level Threads (ULTs) are threads that are entirely managed by the application or a user-level library. The operating system knows nothing about these threads directly.  
  
Here are some key characteristics:

1. **Thread management in user space:** All thread operations (creation, scheduling, synchronization) occur in user mode without switching to the kernel.
2. **Lightweight:** Since context switching happens in user mode, switching between threads is typically faster.
3. **OS sees only one process:** The operating system does not distinguish between user-level threads within the same process. If one thread blocks (e.g., on I/O), the entire process may block.
4. **Limited concurrency on multiprocessor systems:** Because the OS sees just a single process, it may schedule it on only one CPU core at a time, reducing parallelism.

  
Thus, ULTs are advantageous for fast context switching and are easy to manage from a user-level library. However, they may not fully leverage all CPU cores for true parallelism because the OS schedules the entire process as a single entity.

## Kernel-Level Threads

Kernel-Level Threads (KLTs) are managed directly by the operating system kernel. Each thread is visible to the OS, and the kernel can schedule these threads independently on multiple processors.  
  
Key characteristics include:

1. **OS-managed:** The kernel is aware of each thread, allowing for better utilization of multiprocessor or multicore architectures.
2. **Higher overhead:** Because every thread operation (creation, scheduling, context switching) involves system calls, context switching is slower compared to user-level threads.
3. **True concurrency:** Multiple threads of the same process can run in parallel on different CPU cores.
4. **Independence:** If one KLT blocks on I/O, other threads in the same process can continue executing because the OS can schedule them.

  
KLTs provide greater concurrency and better CPU utilization, but at a higher cost in terms of context-switch time and overhead from kernel interactions.

## Mapping Models Between User Threads and Kernel Threads

In addition to distinguishing between user-level and kernel-level threads, it must be understood that the User threads are supported above the Kernel thread and are managed without kernel support, whereas kernel threads are supported and managed directly by the operating system.  
  
Ultimately, a relationship must exist between user threads and kernel threads.![](https://static.takeuforward.org/premium/Process%20Management/Threads%20in%20Operating%20System/Image_2-v-_dWQtr)  
  
There are three common relationships:

### 1. Many-to-One

- **Description:** Multiple user-level threads are mapped onto a single kernel thread.
- **Implementation:** Typically used in older thread libraries; the OS sees only one process context, and all user threads run within that single kernel thread.
- **Pros:**
    - Very fast context switching since it is handled entirely in user space.
    - Less overhead because the OS only deals with one kernel thread.
- **Cons:**
    - If one user thread makes a blocking call, the entire process can block.
    - No true parallelism on multiprocessor systems, as the OS schedules only one kernel thread.

### 2. One-to-One

- **Description:** Each user thread is mapped to a separate kernel thread.
- **Implementation:** Most modern operating systems like Linux and Windows follow this model for their thread libraries.
- **Pros:**
    - Allows true parallelism on multiprocessors; each thread can run on a different core.
    - If one thread blocks, others can continue running.
- **Cons:**
    - Higher overhead due to frequent context switches and kernel-level management.
    - Creating a large number of threads can be resource-intensive.

### 3. Many-to-Many

- **Description:** Multiple user-level threads are mapped to a smaller or equal number of kernel threads.
- **Implementation:** Also referred to as the _m:n_ model. User-level libraries create many threads, and the OS provides a pool of kernel threads to schedule them.
- **Pros:**
    - Balance between concurrency and resource usage; a certain number of kernel threads can run in parallel.
    - If a user thread blocks, the runtime can switch to another user thread mapped to a non-blocked kernel thread.
- **Cons:**
    - More complex to implement because it requires coordination between user-level and kernel-level schedulers.
    - Synchronization can be more involved if the mapping changes dynamically.

## Differences between User-level and Kernel-level threads:

|Criteria|User-Level Threads (ULTs)|Kernel-Level Threads (KLTs)|
|---|---|---|
|**Context Switching**|Fast, done in user space.|Slower, requires system calls.|
|**Blocking**|If one thread blocks, the entire process can block.|If one thread blocks, others can still run.|
|**Scheduling**|Managed by user-level library.|Managed by the operating system kernel.|
|**Concurrency**|Limited on multiprocessor systems because OS sees a single process.|Greater concurrency; OS can schedule threads on multiple cores.|
|**Implementation Complexity**|Simpler from the OS perspective, but user-level libraries can become complex.|More complex at the OS level; requires specialized kernel support.|

#### Conclusion

Both User-Level Threads (ULTs) and Kernel-Level Threads (KLTs) offer ways to achieve concurrency and parallelism. ULTs excel in environments where fast context switching and low overhead are crucial, but they do not fully leverage hardware capabilities for parallelism and can block the entire process when one thread waits for I/O. Meanwhile, KLTs allow true parallelism on multicore systems at the cost of increased overhead due to kernel involvement.  
  
When it comes to the relationship between user threads and kernel threads, three common models—Many-to-One, One-to-One, and Many-to-Many—provide different trade-offs in terms of parallelism, overhead, and flexibility. Modern systems often use a combination of these approaches or stick to the simpler one-to-one model for direct parallelism support.
