## Context

The relevant information that a CPU or system needs to effectively execute a specific process is known as the **context** of that process. This information allows the operating system to manage multiple processes efficiently, ensuring they can pause and resume seamlessly without loss of data or functionality.  
It includes the value of the CPU registers, the process state, memory-management information, etc.  
  

# Context Switching

**Context Switching** is a fundamental concept in operating systems that allows the CPU to switch from one process to another, ensuring multitasking and efficient resource utilization. The CPU executes processes sequentially, but by switching between processes rapidly, it creates the illusion of parallel execution in single-core systems.  

### Real Life Analogy:

Imagine a teacher in a classroom who needs to check the assignments of multiple students. The teacher starts with one student's assignment, marks some of it, then moves on to another student's work, and so on. While the teacher switches between assignments, they keep a note of where they stopped for each student to resume later. Similarly, the CPU keeps track of process states using the **Process Control Block (PCB)** and resumes processes as needed.  
  

### Events During Context Switching:

Context switching involves saving the state of the currently running process and loading the state of the next process to be executed. The events included are as follows:  
  

1. **Interrupt or System Call:** When a process is interrupted (e.g., due to I/O requests or a timer interrupt) or a system call occurs, the operating system gains control of the CPU.
2. **Saving the Current Process State:** The OS saves the current process's state (e.g., program counter, CPU registers, and memory pointers) into its respective PCB. This ensures the process can resume exactly where it left off later.
3. **Loading the Next Process State:** The OS retrieves the state of the next process from its PCB and loads it into the CPU. This allows the new process to start execution or resume from its previous state.
4. **Resuming Execution:** The CPU begins executing the instructions of the newly loaded process, and the cycle continues as needed.

## Diagram of Context Switching

The diagram below illustrates the flow of context switching between two processes, P0 and P1, with the operating system managing the transitions:

**Explanation:**

1. Process P0 is initially executing while P1 is idle.
2. An interrupt or system call causes the OS to save P0’s state into PCB0 and load P1’s state from PCB1.
3. Process P1 begins execution, and P0 enters the idle state.
4. The same process occurs in reverse when the OS switches back to P0.

### Key Components Involved in Context Switching

1. **Process Control Block (PCB):** Stores all the critical information about a process, such as its program counter, CPU registers, and memory pointers.
2. **CPU Registers:** The values of CPU registers are saved and restored during switching to ensure the process resumes correctly.
3. **Interrupts:** Interrupts signal the OS to perform a context switch, such as I/O completion or a timer interrupt.
4. **Scheduler:** Decides which process will execute next, based on scheduling algorithms like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) or Round Robin.

### Advantages of Context Switching

1. **Efficient CPU Utilization:** Ensures that the CPU is never idle and always working on a process.
2. **Multitasking:** Allows multiple processes to progress simultaneously, improving user experience.
3. **Fairness:** Distributes CPU time among processes, ensuring no single process monopolizes resources.
4. **Flexibility:** Adapts to changing workloads and priorities through scheduling.

### Disadvantages of Context Switching

1. **Overhead:** Context switching consumes time and resources, as the CPU must save and load process states.
2. **Performance Impact:** Frequent switching can reduce overall system performance.
3. **Complexity:** Managing PCBs and scheduling algorithms adds complexity to the OS.

### Conclusion

Context switching is a cornerstone of modern operating systems, enabling multitasking and efficient resource utilization. By saving and loading process states using PCBs, the OS ensures smooth transitions between processes. Despite its overhead, context switching is essential for creating a responsive and fair computing environment.
