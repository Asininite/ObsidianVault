# Threads in Operating Systems

**Threads** are the smallest unit of execution within a process in an operating system. They represent a lightweight, independent sequence of instructions that a CPU can execute, allowing tasks to run concurrently within a single process. By using threads, a process can perform multiple operations simultaneously, making the system more efficient and responsive.  
  
**Real-Life Analogy:** Imagine a restaurant where a chef (process) is cooking multiple dishes (threads).

1. While the chef is grilling meat for one dish, they are boiling water for pasta for another.
2. Each dish represents a thread, and the chef (process) manages these tasks concurrently to serve all customers efficiently.

  
A thread is a component of a process that shares the process's resources, such as memory and open files, but executes independently. Multiple threads can exist within the same process, sharing its resources but capable of performing distinct tasks.

### Uses of Threads

Threads are used to achieve:

1. **Concurrency:** Allow multiple tasks to run simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness.
2. **Resource Sharing:** Threads share resources of the parent process, reducing overhead compared to creating new processes.
3. **Improved System Utilization:** Makes better use of CPU cores, especially in multicore systems.

### Types of Threads

Threads can be categorized into two main types:

1. **User-Level Threads:**
    - Managed by user-level libraries rather than the operating system.
    - Faster to create and switch but may block the entire process if one thread is blocked.
2. **Kernel-Level Threads:**
    - Managed directly by the operating system.
    - Slower to create and manage but can take advantage of system-level optimizations.

### Advantages of Using Threads

1. **Faster Context Switching:** Threads have lower overhead compared to processes.
2. **Efficient Resource Sharing:** Threads share the same memory and resources, reducing duplication.
3. **Scalability:** Threads can leverage multicore CPUs for parallelism, improving performance.
4. **Enhanced Responsiveness:** In interactive applications, threads ensure the UI remains responsive even during intensive tasks.

  

### Disadvantages of Using Threads

1. **Complex Debugging:** Multithreaded applications can be harder to debug due to concurrency issues.
2. **Synchronization Overhead:** Threads accessing shared resources require synchronization, which can add complexity and overhead.
3. **Risk of Deadlocks:** Improper synchronization can lead to deadlocks, halting system execution.
4. **System Dependency:** Threading behavior may vary across different operating systems and hardware.

  

---

### Applications of Threads

Threads are widely used in scenarios where concurrency and resource sharing are essential:

- **Web Servers:** Handle multiple client requests simultaneously using threads for each connection.
- **Video Streaming:** Separate threads handle buffering, decoding, and playback for seamless viewing.
- **Interactive Applications:** Maintain responsiveness by separating UI handling from background tasks.

### Threads vs. Processes

Learners often confuse threads with processes. Here’s a clear distinction:

1. **Threads:** Lightweight, share resources, and exist within a process.
2. **Processes:** Heavyweight, have their own memory, and execute independently.

  
In short, threads are designed for concurrency within a process, while processes are designed for isolation and independent execution. 

## ****Types of Thread in Operating System****

Threads are of two types. These are described below.

- User Level Thread 
- Kernel Level Thread

Threads

### 1. User Level Thread

User Level Thread is a type of thread that is not created using system calls. The kernel has no work in the management of user-level threads. User-level threads can be easily implemented by the user. In case when user-level threads are single-handed processes, kernel-level thread manages them. Let's look at the advantages and disadvantages of User-Level Thread.

### ****Advantages of User-Level Threads****

- Implementation of the User-Level Thread is easier than Kernel Level Thread.
- [Context Switch](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/context-switch-in-operating-system) Time is less in User Level Thread.
- User-Level Thread is more efficient than Kernel-Level Thread.
- Because of the presence of only Program Counter, Register Set, and Stack Space, it has a simple representation.

### ****Disadvantages of User-Level Threads****

- The operating system is unaware of user-level threads, so kernel-level optimizations, like load balancing across CPUs, are not utilized.
- If a user-level thread makes a blocking system call, the entire process (and all its threads) is blocked, reducing efficiency.
- User-level thread scheduling is managed by the application, which can become complex and may not be as optimized as kernel-level scheduling.

### 2. Kernel Level Threads

A [kernel Level Thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kernel-level-threads-in-operating-system) is a type of thread that can recognize the Operating system easily. Kernel Level Threads has its own thread table where it keeps track of the system. The operating System Kernel helps in managing threads. Kernel Threads have somehow longer context switching time. Kernel helps in the management of threads.

### ****Advantages of Kernel-Level Threads****

- Kernel-level threads can run on multiple processors or cores simultaneously, enabling better utilization of multicore systems.
- The kernel is aware of all threads, allowing it to manage and schedule them effectively across available resources.
- Applications that block frequency are to be handled by the Kernel-Level Threads.
- The kernel can distribute threads across CPUs, ensuring optimal load balancing and system performance.

### ****Disadvantages of Kernel-Level threads****

- Context switching between kernel-level threads is slower compared to user-level threads because it requires mode switching between user and kernel space.
- Managing kernel-level threads involves frequent system calls and kernel interactions, leading to increased CPU overhead.
- A large number of threads may overload the kernel scheduler, leading to potential performance degradation in systems with many threads.
- Implementation of this type of thread is a little more complex than a user-level thread.

For more, refer to the [Difference Between User-Level Thread and Kernel-Level Thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-user-level-thread-and-kernel-level-thread).

## Difference Between Process and Thread

The primary difference is that threads within the same process run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces. Threads are not independent of one another like processes are, and as a result, threads share with other threads their code section, data section, and OS resources (like open files and signals). But, like a process, a thread has its own [program counter (PC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-program-counter), register set, and stack space. 

For more, refer to [Difference Between Process and Thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-process-and-thread).

## ****What is Multi-Threading?**** 

A thread is also known as a lightweight process. The idea is to achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads. For example, in a [browser](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-browser), multiple tabs can be different threads. MS Word uses multiple threads: one thread to format the text, another thread to process inputs, etc. More advantages of multithreading are discussed below.

[Multithreading](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-operating-system/) is a technique used in operating systems to improve the performance and responsiveness of computer systems. Multithreading allows multiple threads (i.e., lightweight processes) to share the same resources of a single process, such as the CPU, [memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system), and [I/O devices](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/input-and-output-devices).

Single Threaded vs Multi-threaded Process

****Multithreading can be done without OS support****, as seen in Java's multithreading model. In Java, threads are implemented using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which provides its own thread management. These threads, also called user-level threads, are managed independently of the underlying operating system.

Application itself manages the creation, scheduling, and execution of threads without relying on the operating system's kernel. The application contains a threading library that handles thread creation, scheduling, and context switching. The operating system is unaware of User-Level threads and treats the entire process as a single-threaded entity.

## Benefits of Thread in Operating System

- ****Responsiveness****_****:****_ If the process is divided into multiple threads, if one thread completes its execution, then its output can be immediately returned.

- ****Faster context switch****_****:****_ Context switch time between threads is lower compared to the process context switch. Process context switching requires more overhead from the CPU. 

- ****Effective utilization of multiprocessor system****_****:****_ If we have multiple threads in a single process, then we can schedule multiple threads on multiple processors. This will make process execution faster. 

- ****Resource sharing****_****:****_ Resources like code, data, and files can be shared among all threads within a process. Note: Stacks and registers can't be shared among the threads. Each thread has its own stack and registers. 

- ****Communication****_****:****_ Communication between multiple threads is easier, as the threads share a common address space. while in the process we have to follow some specific communication techniques for communication between the two processes. 

- ****Enhanced throughput of the system****_****:****_ If a process is divided into multiple threads, and each thread function is considered as one job, then the number of jobs completed per unit of time is increased, thus increasing the throughput of the system.
