Scheduling is a fundamental component of operating systems that ensures processes are executed efficiently. It involves the management of queues and the coordination of schedulers to achieve optimal CPU and resource utilization.

# Scheduling Queues

As processes enter the system, they are placed into different types of scheduling queues, which guide their journey through the system. These queues include:

1. **Job Queue:** Contains all processes in the system. Processes awaiting their turn for execution reside here.
2. **Ready Queue:** Holds processes that are in main memory, ready, and waiting for CPU allocation. This queue is typically implemented as a linked list. The ready-queue header points to the first and last Process Control Blocks (PCBs), and each PCB points to the next PCB in the queue.
3. **Device Queue:** Contains processes waiting for a particular I/O device. Each device has its own queue, ensuring processes are served based on device availability.

### Flow of Processes in Scheduling Queues:

Processes migrate among these queues throughout their lifecycle. For instance:

1. A new process is initially placed in the ready queue.
2. After being dispatched for execution, the process may:
    - Issue an I/O request and be placed in an I/O queue.
    - Create a child process and wait for its termination.
    - Be interrupted and returned to the ready queue.
3. Upon completion, the process is removed from all queues, and its PCB and resources are deallocated.

# Schedulers

Schedulers (also called process schedulers) manage the selection of processes for execution and ensure a balanced load on system resources. There are three primary types of schedulers:

### Long-Term Scheduler (Job Scheduler):

- Selects processes from the job queue and loads them into memory for execution.
- Controls the degree of multiprogramming by determining how many processes should reside in memory at a given time.
- Must carefully select a mix of I/O-bound and CPU-bound processes to balance system performance.

### Short-Term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler):

- Selects from processes in the ready queue for CPU allocation.
- Executes frequently, often once every 100 milliseconds, making speed a critical factor.
- Ensures efficient CPU utilization by minimizing idle time.

### Medium-Term Scheduler:

- Introduced in some systems to temporarily remove processes from memory (swapping).
- Reduces the degree of multiprogramming and manages memory overcommitment.
- Reintroduces swapped-out processes into memory when resources become available.

### Key Functions of Schedulers

Schedulers play a crucial role in process management and overall system performance. Their key functions include:

1. **Resource Allocation:** Efficiently allocates CPU, memory, and I/O devices to processes.
2. **Load Balancing:** Maintains a balance between I/O-bound and CPU-bound processes to avoid system bottlenecks.
3. **Process Prioritization:** Determines the priority of processes, ensuring critical processes are served promptly.
4. **Performance Optimization:** Enhances throughput, CPU utilization, and system responsiveness.

### Real-Life Analogy

Here is a real-life analogy for better understanding, Imagine a busy airport terminal:

1. The job queue is like passengers arriving at the terminal, waiting to board their flights.
2. The ready queue resembles passengers ready to board but waiting at their respective gates.
3. Device queues are analogous to passengers waiting for specific services, such as baggage check or security clearance.
4. Schedulers act as the airport staff, ensuring smooth flow and timely allocation of resources like boarding passes and flight gates.

### Importance of Scheduling

Scheduling is vital for ensuring efficient system performance by:

1. Maximizing resource utilization and minimizing idle time.
2. Balancing workloads to prevent system bottlenecks.
3. Providing a seamless experience for both system users and administrators.
