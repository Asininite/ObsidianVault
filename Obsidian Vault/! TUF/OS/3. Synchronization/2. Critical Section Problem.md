A critical section is a segment of a program where shared resources, such as memory, files, or ports, are accessed by multiple processes or threads. To prevent issues like data inconsistency and race conditions, synchronization techniques ensure that only one process or thread accesses the critical section at a time.

## **Structure of a Critical Section**

**Entry Section**
- The process requests permission to enter the critical section.
- Synchronization tools (e.g., mutex, semaphore) are used to control access.

**Critical Section**
- The actual code where shared resources are accessed or modified.

**Exit Section***
- The process releases the lock or semaphore, allowing other processes to enter the critical section.

**Remainder Section***
- The rest of the program that does not involve shared resource access.

## Characteristics of Critical Section
### Mutual Exclusion
Only one process or thread can execute in the critical section at a given time.
### Progress
If no process is executing in its critical section and some processes wish to enter their critical sections, then only those processes that are **not executing** in their remainder sections can **participate** in deciding which will enter its critical section next, and this selection cannot be postponed indefinitely.
### Bounded Waiting
There must be a limit on how many times other processes are allowed to enter the critical section before a waiting process gets its turn. It is important to prevent [**starvation**,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/starvation-and-aging-in-operating-systems/) where one process waits indefinitely while others repeatedly enter the critical section.
