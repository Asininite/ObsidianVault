****Race condition**** occurs when multiple threads read and write the same variable i.e. they have access to some shared data and they try to change it at the same time. In such a scenario threads are “racing” each other to access/change the data. This is a major security vulnerability.

### Example 1 - Consider an ATM Withdrawal

Imagine Ram and his friend Sham both have access to the same bank account. They both try to withdraw Rs,500 at the same time from different ATMs. The system checks the balance and sees there’s enough money for both withdrawals. Without proper synchronization, the system might allow both transactions to go through, even if the balance is only enough for one, leaving the account overdrawn.

## Key Terms in a Race Condition

- **Critical Section**: A code part where the shared resources are accessed. It is critical as multiple processes enter this section at same time leading to data corruption and errors.
- **Synchronization:*** It is the process of controlling how and when multiple processes or threads access the shared resources ensuring that only one can enter the [critical section](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-70/) at same time.
- **Mutual Exclusion (Mutex):** A mutex is like a lock that ensures only one process can access a resource at a time. If a process holds a lock, others must wait their turn preventing race conditions.
- **Deadlock***: A situation where two or more processes are stuck waiting for each other's resources, causing a deadlock(standstill).

### 1. Race Condition
A race condition happens when two or more processes try to **access the same resource at the same time without proper coordination**. This “race” can lead to incorrect results or unpredictable behavior because the order of execution is not controlled.

Example: Two people trying to edit the same document at the same time, causing one’s changes to overwrite the other’s.

### 2. Deadlock
A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are waiting for each other to release resources, and none can proceed. It’s like a standstill where each process is holding a resource the other needs, leading to a complete freeze.

Example: Two cars stuck in a narrow road from opposite directions, each refusing to move back and waiting for the other.

### 3. Thread Block
Thread blocking happens when a thread is unable to continue its work because it’s waiting for a resource that’s currently unavailable. It pauses until the resource is free.

Example: A cashier waiting for the customer ahead to finish paying before attending to the next person in line
