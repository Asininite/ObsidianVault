# Semaphores in Process Synchronization

Semaphores are a tool used in operating systems to help manage how different processes (or programs) share resources, like memory or data, without causing conflicts. A semaphore is a special kind of synchronization data that can be used only through specific synchronization primitives. Semaphores are used to implement critical sections, which are regions of code that must be executed by only one process at a time. By using semaphores, processes can coordinate access to shared resources, such as shared memory or I/O devices.

## What is Semaphores?

A semaphore is a synchronization tool used in concurrent programming to manage access to shared resources. It is a [lock-based mechanism](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lock-variable-synchronization-mechanism/) designed to achieve process synchronization, built on top of basic locking techniques.

Semaphores use a counter to control access, allowing synchronization for multiple instances of a resource. Processes can attempt to access one instance, and if it is not available, they can try other instances. Unlike basic locks, which allow only one process to access one instance of a resource. Semaphores can handle more complex synchronization scenarios, involving multiple processes or threads. It help prevent problems like [***race conditions***](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/race-condition-vulnerability/) by controlling when and how processes access shared data.

The process of using Semaphores provides two operations:

- ***wait (P):*** The wait operation decrements the value of the semaphore
- ***signal (V):*** The signal operation increments the value of the semaphore.

When the value of the semaphore is zero, any process that performs a wait operation will be blocked until another process performs a signal operation.

When a process performs a wait operation on a semaphore, the operation checks whether the value of the semaphore is **>0**. If so, it decrements the value of the semaphore and lets the process continue its execution; otherwise, it blocks the process on the semaphore. A signal operation on a semaphore activates a process blocked on the semaphore if any, or increments the value of the semaphore by 1. Due to these semantics, semaphores are also called counting semaphores. The initial value of a semaphore determines how many processes can get past the wait operation.

Semaphores are required for [process synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/) to make sure that multiple processes can safely share resources without interfering with each other. They help control when a process can access a shared resource, preventing issues like **race*** conditions.

## **Types of Semaphores**

Semaphores are of two Types:

- **Binary Semaphore:** This is also known as a mutex lock, as they are locks that provide mutual exclusion. It can have only two values - 0 and 1. Its value is initialized to 1. It is used to implement the solution of critical section problems with multiple processes and a single resource.
- **Counting Semaphore:** Counting semaphores can be used to control access to a given resource consisting of a finite number of instances. The semaphore is initialized to the number of resources available. Its value can range over an unrestricted domain.

## Working of Semaphore

A semaphore is a simple yet powerful synchronization tool used to manage access to shared resources in a system with multiple processes. It works by maintaining a counter that controls access to a specific resource, ensuring that no more than the allowed number of processes access the resource at the same time.

There are two primary operations that a semaphore can perform:

1. **Wait (P operation)**: This operation checks the semaphore's value. If the value is greater than 0, the process is allowed to continue, and the semaphore's value is decremented by 1. If the value is 0, the process is blocked (waits) until the semaphore value becomes greater than 0.
2. **Signal (V operation)**: After a process is done using the shared resource, it performs the signal operation. This increments the semaphore's value by 1, potentially unblocking other waiting processes and allowing them to access the resource.

Now let us see how it does so. First, look at two operations that can be used to access and change the value of the semaphore variable.

![semaphores](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250106165446247852/semaphores.webp)

  

A [critical section](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-70/) is surrounded by both operations to implement process synchronization. The below image demonstrates the basic mechanism of how semaphores are used to control access to a critical section in a multi-process environment, ensuring that only one process can access the shared resource at a time

![Critical](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250106173455387890/Critical.png)

Now, let us see how it implements mutual exclusion. Let there be two processes P1 and P2 and a semaphore s is initialized as 1. Now if suppose P1 enters in its critical section then the value of semaphore s becomes 0. Now if P2 wants to enter its critical section then it will wait until s > 0, this can only happen when P1 finishes its critical section and calls V operation on semaphore s.

This way mutual exclusion is achieved. Look at the below image for details which is a Binary semaphore.

![Mutual Exclusion using Semaphore](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Semaphores_3.jpg)


#### **Implementation -** Binary Semaphores
```cpp
struct semaphore {
  
    enum value(0, 1);

    // q contains all Process Control Blocks (PCBs)
    // corresponding to processes got blocked
    // while performing down operation.
    Queue<process> q;

};
P(semaphore s)
{
    if (s.value == 1) {
        s.value = 0;
    }
    else {
        // add the process to the waiting queue
        q.push(P) sleep();
    }
}
V(semaphore s)
{
    if (s.q is empty) {
        s.value = 1;
    }
    else {

        // select a process from waiting queue
        Process p = q.front();
        // remove the process from waiting as it has been
        // sent for CS
        q.pop();
        wakeup(p);
    }
}
```



The description above is for binary semaphore which can take only two values 0 and 1 and ensure mutual exclusion. There is one other type of semaphore called counting semaphore which can take values greater than one.

Now suppose there is a resource whose number of instances is 4. Now we initialize S = 4 and the rest is the same as for binary semaphore. Whenever the process wants that resource it calls P or waits for function and when it is done it calls V or signal function. If the value of S becomes zero then a process has to wait until S becomes positive. For example, Suppose there are 4 processes P1, P2, P3, and P4, and they all call wait operation on S(initialized with 4). If another process P5 wants the resource then it should wait until one of the four processes calls the signal function and the value of semaphore becomes positive.

### **Limitations**

- One of the biggest limitations of semaphore is [priority inversions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-inversion-what-the-heck/).
- Deadlock, suppose a process is trying to wake up another process that is not in a sleep state. Therefore, a deadlock may be blocked indefinitely.
- The operating system has to keep track of all calls to wait and signal the semaphore.

The main problem with semaphores is that they require busy waiting, If a process is in the critical section, then other processes trying to enter the critical section will be waiting until the critical section is not occupied by any process. Whenever any process waits then it continuously checks for semaphore value (look at this line while (s==0); in P operation) and wastes CPU cycle.

There is also a chance of "spinlock" as the processes keep on spinning while waiting for the lock. To avoid this another implementation is provided below.

## **Implementation** - Counting semaphore

```cpp
struct Semaphore {

    int value;

    // q contains all Process Control Blocks(PCBs)
    // corresponding to processes got blocked
    // while performing down operation.
    Queue<process> q;

};
P(Semaphore s)
{
    s.value = s.value - 1;
    if (s.value < 0) {

        // add process to queue
        // here p is a process which is currently executing
        q.push(p);
        block();
    }
    else
        return;
}

V(Semaphore s)
{
    s.value = s.value + 1;
    if (s.value <= 0) {

        // remove process p from queue
        Process p = q.pop();
        wakeup(p);
    }
    else
        return;
}
```
In this implementation whenever the process waits it is added to a waiting queue of processes associated with that semaphore. This is done through the system call block() on that process. When a process is completed it calls the signal function and one process in the queue is resumed. It uses the wakeup() system call.

## Uses of Semaphores

- ****Mutual Exclusion**** : Semaphore ensures that only one process accesses a shared resource at a time.
- ****Process Synchronization**** : Semaphore coordinates the execution order of multiple processes.
- ****Resource Management**** : Limits access to a finite set of resources, like printers, devices, etc.
- ****Reader-Writer Problem**** : Allows multiple readers but restricts the writers until no reader is present.
- ****Avoiding Deadlocks**** : Prevents deadlocks by controlling the order of allocation of resources.

## Advantages of Semaphores

- Semaphore is a simple and effective mechanism for process synchronization
- Supports coordination between multiple processes. By controlling the access to critical sections, semaphores help in managing multiple processes without them interfering with each other.
- When used correctly, semaphores can help avoid deadlocks by managing access to resources efficiently and ensuring that no process is indefinitely blocked from accessing necessary resources.
- Semaphores help prevent race conditions by ensuring that only one process can access a shared resource at a time.
- Provides a flexible and robust way to manage shared resources.

## Disadvantages of Semaphores

- It Can lead to performance degradation due to overhead associated with wait and signal operations.
- If semaphores are not managed carefully, they can lead to [deadlock](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/). This often occurs when semaphores are not released properly or when processes acquire semaphores in an inconsistent order.
- It can cause performance issues in a program if not used properly.
- It can be difficult to debug and maintain. Debugging systems that rely heavily on semaphores can be challenging, as it is hard to track the state of each semaphore and ensure that all processes are correctly synchronized
- It can be prone to race conditions and other synchronization problems if not used correctly.
- It can be vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as denial of service attacks.

## Classical Synchronization Problems using Semaphores Concept

These are the classical synchronization problem using the concept of semaphores.

### 1. Producer-Consumer Problem

The [producer-consumer problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/producer-consumer-problem-using-semaphores-set-1/) involves two types of processes producers that generate data and consumers that process data. The Producer-Consumer Problem is like a restaurant where the chef (producer) makes food and the customer (consumer) eats it. The counter (buffer: A fixed-size queue where producers place items and consumers remove items.) holds food temporarily. A special lock (semaphore) ensures the chef doesn't overflow the counter and the customer doesn't take food when it's not available. In This way, everything runs smoothly and efficiently and gives faster results.

****Semaphores Used****

- empty: Counts the number of empty slots in the buffer
- full: Counts the number of full slots in the buffer
- mutex: Locks access to the buffer (mutual exclusion)

### 2. Traffic Light Control

****Description:**** Traffic lights at an intersection can be managed using semaphores to control the flow of traffic and ensure safe crossing.

****Example:****

****Traffic Lights:**** Represented by semaphores that control the green, yellow, and red lights for different directions.

****Semaphores Used:**** Each light direction is controlled by a semaphore that manages the timing and transitions between light states.

****Implementation****

****Light Controller:**** Uses semaphores to cycle through green, yellow, and red lights. The controller ensures that only one direction has the green light at a time and manages transitions to avoid conflicts.

### ****3. Bank Transaction Processing****

- ****Multiple Transactions:**** Processes that need to access shared resources (accounts)
- ****Account Balance:**** Shared resource represented by a semaphore
- ****Semaphore value:**** 1 (only one transaction can access and modify an account at a time is crucial for maintaining data integrity).

### ****Process****

- ****Acquire Semaphore:**** A transaction must need to acquire the semaphore first before modifying an account balance.
- ****The account**** is ****:**** Then operations like debiting or crediting the account are performed by the transaction.
- ****Release Semaphore:**** After Completing the transactions the semaphore is released to allow other transactions to proceed.

### 4. Print Queue Management

- ****Multiple Print Jobs:**** Processes that need to access shared resources (printers)
- ****Printer:**** Shared resource represented by a semaphore
- ****Semaphore Value:**** 1 (only one print job can access the printer at a time)

### Process

- ****Acquire Semaphore:**** First, acquire a semaphore for the printer to begin the print job.
- ****Print Job Execution:**** The printer processes the print job.
- ****Release Semaphore:**** Now the semaphore is released after the job is done.

### 5. Railway Track Management

- ****Multiple Trains:**** Processes that need to access shared resources (tracks)
- ****Track:**** Shared resource represented by a semaphore
- ****Semaphore Value:**** 1 (only one train can access the track at a time)

### Process

- ****Acquire Semaphore:**** A train acquires the semaphore before entering a track.
- ****Travel Across Track:**** train Travels across the track.
- ****Release Semaphore:**** The semaphores are released after the train passes the track.

### 6. Dining Philosopher's Problem

- ****Multiple Philosophers:**** Process that needs to access shared resources(forks).
- ****Forks:**** Shared resources represented by semaphores, that need to eat. Each philosopher needs two forks to eat.
- ****Semaphore Value:**** 1 (Only one philosopher can access a fork at a time preventing deadlock and starvation).

### Process

- ****Acquire Forks:**** Philosophers acquire the semaphore for both the left and right forks before eating.
- ****Eat**** eat ****:**** When both the forks are acquired then the philosopher eats.
- ****Release Forks:**** After eating, both the forks are released for others to use them.

### 7. Reader-Writer Problem

In [Reader-Writer problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/readers-writers-problem-set-1-introduction-and-readers-preference-solution/) Synchronizing access to shared data where multiple readers can read the data simultaneously, but writers need exclusive access to modify it. In simple terms imagine a library where multiple readers and writers come and all readers want to read a book, and some people(writers) want to update or edit the book. That's why we need a system to ensure that these actions are done smoothly without errors or conflicts.

- ****Multiple Readers and Writers:**** Processes that need to access a shared resource(data).
- ****Data:**** Shared resources represented by a Semaphore.
- ****Semaphore Value for Reader:**** Process that reads shared data, Can access simultaneously(value>1, more than one reader can access at the same time)
- ****Semaphore Value for Writers:**** Processes that modify shared data need exclusive access(value =1, one at a time)

****Solution**** -

- [Writers Preference Solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/readers-writers-problem-writers-preference-solution/)

## ****Conclusion****

Process Synchronization is an important of concurrent computing, ensuring that multiple processes can execute without interfering with each other. Semaphores can be used to tackle classic synchronization challenges in computing. It plays a vital role In managing access to shared resources and coordinating the activities of concurrent processes. It also helps to improve system performance, maintain data integrity, and remove the conflicts between the processes. Effective process synchronization ensures consistency, stability, and efficiency in multi-threaded and multi-process systems.
