# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

CPU scheduling algorithms are essential in operating systems to efficiently manage the execution of processes. These algorithms determine the sequence in which processes will access the CPU, maximizing performance and ensuring fair resource allocation.

---

## 1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)

The First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm executes processes in the order they arrive in the ready queue. It operates like a queue, where the first process to arrive is the first to execute.  
**Real Life Analogy:** Imagine standing in line at a grocery store. The first person in line (the first process) is served first, followed by the next person.  
  

### Key Features of FCFS

1. Simple and easy to implement.
2. Non-preemptive: Once a process starts, it runs to completion.

### Advantages of FCFS

1. Easy to understand and implement.
2. Fair for processes as they are served in the order they arrive.

### Disadvantages of FCFS

1. Can lead to poor CPU utilization due to the "convoy effect."
2. Not suitable for time-sharing systems.

```cpp
// C++ program for implementation of FCFS 
// scheduling
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to find the waiting time for all 
// processes
void findWaitingTime(int processes[], int n, 
                          int bt[], int wt[])
{
    // waiting time for first process is 0
    wt[0] = 0;

    // calculating waiting time
    for (int  i = 1; i < n ; i++ )
        wt[i] =  bt[i-1] + wt[i-1] ;
}

// Function to calculate turn around time
void findTurnAroundTime( int processes[], int n, 
                  int bt[], int wt[], int tat[])
{
    // calculating turnaround time by adding
    // bt[i] + wt[i]
    for (int  i = 0; i < n ; i++)
        tat[i] = bt[i] + wt[i];
}

//Function to calculate average time
void findavgTime( int processes[], int n, int bt[])
{
    int wt[n], tat[n], total_wt = 0, total_tat = 0;

    //Function to find waiting time of all processes
    findWaitingTime(processes, n, bt, wt);

    //Function to find turn around time for all processes
    findTurnAroundTime(processes, n, bt, wt, tat);

    //Display processes along with all details
    cout << "Processes  "<< " Burst time  "
         << " Waiting time  " << " Turn around time\n";

    // Calculate total waiting time and total turn 
    // around time
    for (int  i=0; i<n; i++)
    {
        total_wt = total_wt + wt[i];
        total_tat = total_tat + tat[i];
        cout << "   " << i+1 << "\t\t" << bt[i] <<"\t    "
            << wt[i] <<"\t\t  " << tat[i] <<endl;
    }

    cout << "Average waiting time = " 
         << (float)total_wt / (float)n;
    cout << "\nAverage turn around time = " 
         << (float)total_tat / (float)n;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
    //process id's
    int processes[] = { 1, 2, 3};
    int n = sizeof processes / sizeof processes[0];

    //Burst time of all processes
    int  burst_time[] = {10, 5, 8};

    findavgTime(processes, n,  burst_time);
    return 0;
}
```

## 2. Shortest Job First (SJF)

The Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm selects the process with the shortest burst time for execution. It minimizes the average waiting time.  
**Real Life Analogy:** At a restaurant, orders that take less time to prepare are served first, optimizing the service speed.  
  

### Key Features of SJF

1. Efficient in minimizing average waiting time.
2. Can be preemptive or non-preemptive.

### Advantages of SJF

1. Minimizes average waiting time.
2. Efficient for batch processing systems.

### Disadvantages of SJF

1. Starvation: Long processes may wait indefinitely.
2. Requires knowledge of burst times, which may not always be available.

## 3. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)

The Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) is a preemptive version of SJF, where the process with the shortest remaining time is executed next.  
**Real Life Analogy:** Consider a post office where shorter tasks (like sending a letter) are prioritized over longer ones (like registering a parcel).  
  

### Key Features of SRTF

1. Preemptive scheduling.
2. Minimizes average turnaround time.

### Advantages of SRTF

1. Reduces average waiting and turnaround time.
2. Efficient for systems with mixed task durations.

### Disadvantages of SRTF

1. Starvation of longer processes is possible.
2. Overhead in context switching.
