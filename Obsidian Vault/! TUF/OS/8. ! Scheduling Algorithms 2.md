# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

CPU scheduling algorithms are essential in operating systems to efficiently manage the execution of processes. These algorithms determine the sequence in which processes will access the CPU, maximizing performance and ensuring fair resource allocation.

## 1. Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)

The Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) algorithm prioritizes processes based on their response ratio, calculated as:  
  
Response Ratio = (Waiting Time + Burst Time) / Burst Time  
	$$(WT + BT) / BT$$
**Real Life Analogy:** At a ticket counter, customers who have been waiting longer are prioritized, but shorter tasks are still completed quickly.  
  

### Advantages of HRRN

1. Balances fairness and efficiency.
2. Prevents starvation of long processes.

---

## 2. Round Robin (RR)

The Round Robin (RR) algorithm allocates the CPU to each process for a fixed time slice, then moves to the next process in the queue.  
**Real Life Analogy:** In a multiplayer game, each player gets a turn to play for a fixed amount of time.  
  

### Key Features of RR

1. Preemptive: Ensures no single process monopolizes the CPU.
2. Time slice determines performance.

### Advantages of RR

1. Ensures fairness among processes.
2. Reduces waiting time for smaller tasks.

### Disadvantages of RR

1. Performance depends on time slice selection.
2. Overhead in context switching.

---

## 3. Priority-Based Scheduling (PBS)

The Priority-Based Scheduling (PBS) algorithm selects the process with the highest priority for execution.  
**Real Life Analogy:** Emergency cases in a hospital are attended to before less critical cases.  
  

### Key Features of PBS

1. Can be preemptive or non-preemptive.
2. Processes are executed based on priority levels.

### Advantages of PBS

1. Handles critical tasks efficiently.
2. Flexible for system requirements.

### Disadvantages of PBS

1. Starvation: Low-priority processes may wait indefinitely.
2. Requires a mechanism to determine priorities.

---

## 4. Multilevel Queue (MLQ)

The Multilevel Queue (MLQ) algorithm divides processes into categories, each assigned to a specific queue with its own scheduling policy.  
**Real Life Analogy:** A customer service system with separate queues for VIPs, regular customers, and inquiries.  
  

### Advantages of MLQ

1. Efficient for categorizing and managing diverse processes.
2. Provides flexibility with different scheduling policies.

### Disadvantages of MLQ

1. Rigid queue definitions can lead to inefficiency.
2. Complex to implement.

---

## 5. Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

The Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) algorithm is an enhancement of MLQ that allows processes to move between queues based on their behavior and requirements.  
**Real Life Analogy:** Students in a class are reassigned to different groups based on their performance and learning needs.  
  

### Advantages of MLFQ

1. Adaptive and flexible for various workloads.
2. Minimizes starvation by dynamically adjusting priorities.

### Disadvantages of MLFQ

1. High complexity in implementation.
2. Overhead in managing multiple queues.
