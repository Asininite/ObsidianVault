# Process Scheduling

The **Operating System (OS)** is responsible for managing processes efficiently to ensure optimal performance and responsiveness. Process scheduling plays a pivotal role by determining the order in which processes execute, especially in systems handling multiple tasks simultaneously.

### Real Life Analogy:

Imagine a single cashier at a busy supermarket checkout counter. The cashier needs to decide which customer to serve first: based on their arrival time, the size of their cart, or if one customer is in a hurry (priority). The strategy used by the cashier represents the process scheduling mechanism of an OS.  

## Need of Process Scheduling

Process scheduling is essential for the following reasons:

1. **Efficient CPU Utilization:** Ensures that the CPU is always busy by assigning it tasks when others are waiting for resources like I/O.
2. **Handling Multiple Processes:** Manages a queue of processes to ensure fair allocation of system resources.
3. **Avoiding Deadlock and Starvation:** Prevents situations where certain processes never get executed.
4. **Meeting Deadlines:** For real-time systems, processes must be executed within specific time constraints.

## Factors Considered During Scheduling

When scheduling a process, the OS considers several factors:

1. **Process Priority:** High-priority processes are often executed before others.
2. **Arrival Time:** Determines when a process enters the ready queue.
3. **Burst Time:** Represents the time required by the CPU to execute the process.
4. **I/O or CPU-Bound Nature:** Processes that rely on I/O devices may need to wait, while CPU-bound processes are executed immediately.
5. **Deadline:** Some processes have strict deadlines, especially in real-time systems.

# Process Scheduling Algorithms

There are various algorithms that OS uses for scheduling processes based on various conditions. These algorithms are commonly known as **Process Scheduling Algorithms**.  
  
They can be broadly classified into two types:

- Preemptive Scheduling Algorithms
- Non-Preemptive Scheduling Algorithms

## Preemptive Scheduling

Preemptive scheduling allows the OS to interrupt an executing process to assign the CPU to another (with a higher-priority) process.  

###### Real Life Analogy:

Imagine a manager interrupting an employee to prioritize an urgent task. The employee pauses their current work and resumes it after completing the urgent task.  
  
**Advantages:**

- Improves responsiveness, especially for high-priority tasks.
- Minimizes the chances of starvation for processes with strict deadlines.

  
**Disadvantages:**

- Increased overhead due to frequent context switching.
- Complex implementation compared to non-preemptive scheduling.

**Examples of Usage:** Preemptive scheduling is commonly used in real-time systems and interactive environments where responsiveness is critical.  
  

## Non-Preemptive Scheduling

Non-preemptive scheduling allows a process to execute until completion or voluntarily relinquishes the CPU. The OS does not interrupt an executing process.  

###### Real Life Analogy:

Think of a customer at a service counter who completes their transaction without interruption before the next customer is attended to.  
  
**Advantages:**

- Low overhead since there are no frequent context switches.
- Simple to implement and understand.

**Disadvantages:**

- Low-priority processes may experience starvation.
- Less responsive to high-priority tasks.

**Examples of Usage:** Non-preemptive scheduling is often used in batch processing systems where processes are executed in the order they arrive.

### Differences Between Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling

|Aspect|Preemptive Scheduling|Non-Preemptive Scheduling|
|---|---|---|
|Interruptions|Processes can be interrupted mid-execution.|Processes execute until completion without interruption.|
|Responsiveness|High, especially for high-priority tasks.|Low, as tasks are completed in the order of arrival.|
|Complexity|High, due to context switching and resource allocation.|Low, as processes run sequentially.|
|Overhead|Higher due to frequent context switches.|Lower as no preemption occurs.|

  

### Uses of different Scheduling:

**Preemptive Scheduling:** Used in systems where responsiveness is critical, such as:

- Real-time systems (e.g., embedded systems).
- Interactive environments (e.g., operating systems handling multiple user inputs).

  
**Non-Preemptive Scheduling:** Preferred in environments where simplicity and low overhead are more important, such as:

- Batch processing systems.
- Applications with no strict timing requirements.
