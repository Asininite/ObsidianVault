## 1. Relational Databases

Definition: Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns, using structured query language (SQL) for querying. They rely on a schema to define data organization and enforce data integrity through rules and constraints. In a relational database, data is structured, and relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys.

### Characteristics:

- Structured data: Organized into tables, making it easy to understand.
- ACID compliance: Ensures data integrity with Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
- Relationships: Data can be linked through primary and foreign keys.
- Scalability: Typically scales vertically (adding more resources to a single server).

### Example: University Student Records

Imagine a university database with three tables: Students, Courses, and Enrollments.

#### Table Structure:

|Table|Description|
|---|---|
|Students|Stores student information with columns student_id, name, age, major.|
|Courses|Stores course information with columns course_id, course_name, credits.|
|Enrollments|Links students to courses, using student_id and course_id as foreign keys.|

### Practical Example

```
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    major VARCHAR(50)
);
CREATE TABLE Courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(50),
    credits INT
);
CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Courses(course_id)
);
```

### Example Query: Find students enrolled in "Database Systems."

```
SELECT Students.name, Courses.course_name
FROM Students
JOIN Enrollments ON Students.student_id = Enrollments.student_id
JOIN Courses ON Enrollments.course_id = Courses.course_id
WHERE Courses.course_name = 'Database Systems';
```

### Schema Definitions for the Tables

#### Table: Students

|Column|Data Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|student_id|INT (Primary Key)|Unique ID for each student|
|name|VARCHAR(50)|Name of the student|
|age|INT|Age of the student|
|major|VARCHAR(50)|Student's major/field|

#### Table: Courses

|Column|Data Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|course_id|INT (Primary Key)|Unique ID for each course|
|course_name|VARCHAR(50)|Name of the course|
|credits|INT|Credit hours for the course|

#### Table: Enrollments

|Column|Data Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|enrollment_id|INT (Primary Key)|Unique ID for each enrollment record|
|student_id|INT (Foreign Key)|References student_id in Students table|
|course_id|INT (Foreign Key)|References course_id in Courses table|

### Use Cases

Banking systems, inventory management, and academic records where structured data and relationships are essential.

## 2. NoSQL Databases

Definition: NoSQL databases are non-relational and ideal for storing large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They offer flexibility in schema, allowing changes without affecting the entire database structure. NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL," which means these databases can support other querying mechanisms beyond SQL.

### Characteristics:

- Flexible schema: Adaptable to evolving data structures.
- High scalability: Often horizontally scalable, handling large amounts of data.
- Variety: Includes document, key-value, column-family, and graph databases.
- Distributed: Many NoSQL databases are designed for distributed environments.

### Example: E-commerce Product Inventory (Document-Oriented)

```
{
    "_id": 1,
    "name": "Laptop",
    "category": "Electronics",
    "price": 899.99,
    "stock": 50,
    "details": {
        "brand": "BrandX",
        "features": ["8GB RAM", "256GB SSD", "Intel i5"]
    }
}
```

### MongoDB Query Example

```
db.Products.find({ price: { $gt: 500 } });
```

## 3. Hierarchical Databases

Definition: Hierarchical databases organize data in a tree-like structure, where each record has a single parent and possibly multiple children. This model is based on a parent-child relationship, making it suitable for representing one-to-many relationships.

### Characteristics:

- Rigid structure: Based on predefined relationships; does not allow many-to-many relationships.
- High performance: Good for applications where data relationships are hierarchical and unlikely to change.
- Fast data retrieval: Efficient for navigational access.

### Example: Company Organizational Structure

|Level|Employee Name|Reports To|
|---|---|---|
|CEO|John Smith|NULL|
|VP of Marketing|Sarah Johnson|John Smith|
|Marketing Manager 1|Emily Brown|Sarah Johnson|
|VP of Sales|Michael Green|John Smith|

### Use Cases

Telecommunications directories, organizational charts, and file systems.

## 4. Network Databases

Definition: Network databases use a graph structure to handle complex relationships with many-to-many connections. Data is organized as records connected by links, making it useful for applications with highly interconnected data.

### Characteristics:

- Flexible relationships: Supports complex many-to-many relationships.
- Performance: Efficient for applications with complex data relationships.
- Navigational: Data access paths are pre-defined, enhancing query performance.

### Example: Social Network Connections

|User ID|Name|Connected To (User ID)|
|---|---|---|
|1|Alice|2, 3|
|2|Bob|1, 3, 4|
|3|Charlie|1, 2|
|4|Dave|2|

### Use Cases

Social networks, telecommunication networks, and supply chain management.

## 5. Object-Oriented Databases

Definition: Object-oriented databases store data as objects, similar to the objects used in object-oriented programming (OOP). These databases integrate with OOP languages, allowing complex data types and supporting inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

### Characteristics:

- Data as objects: Stores data in object form, supporting OOP principles.
- Complex data types: Allows for nested objects and complex relationships.
- Direct mapping: Simplifies application-database integration for OOP languages.

### Example: Library System

```
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, isbn):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.isbn = isbn

    def display_info(self):
        return f"{self.title} by {self.author}, ISBN: {self.isbn}"
```

Each Book object represents a record in the database.

### Use Cases

		CAD/CAM systems, multimedia applications, and applications where data structure is complex and hierarchical.
