## 1. What is Data?

Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts and figures. It can exist in forms such as numbers, text, symbols, images, or sounds, and does not carry specific meaning by itself. When organized or processed, data becomes meaningful information.

### Types of Data

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Numerical|Data represented by numbers|123, 45.67, -34|
|Textual|Data represented in words or characters|"Hello", "Database"|
|Boolean|Data represented in true or false values|true, false|
|Categorical|Data categorized into distinct groups or classes|Male/Female, Product A/B/C|

## 2. Data Hierarchy

Data hierarchy represents the levels of data organization, starting with the smallest element and moving to complex levels for meaningful information.

|Level|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Bit|The smallest unit of data, represented as 0 or 1|0, 1|
|Byte|8 bits make up a byte|ASCII code for "A" is 65|
|Field|A single piece of data|"John", "25"|
|Record|A collection of related fields|{Name: John, Age: 25}|
|File|A collection of related records|A customer data file|
|Database|A structured set of files/data stored for easy access|A school database with student info|

## 3. What is Information?

Information is data that has been processed and organized in a way that adds meaning, making it useful for decision-making.

### Example: Data vs. Information

|Data|Information|
|---|---|
|{Marks: [55, 78, 62, 85]}|"Average Marks: 70"|
|{Time Logs: [9:00, 17:00]}|"Employee worked 8 hours today"|
|{Temperature: [30°C, 35°C]}|"Average temperature this week: 32.5°C"|

## 4. What is a Database?

A database is a structured collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated efficiently. Databases are essential for storing information in an organized way.

### Types of Databases

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Relational Database|Uses tables (relations) to organize data|MySQL, PostgreSQL|
|NoSQL Database|Non-tabular, flexible schema structure|MongoDB, Cassandra|
|In-Memory Database|Stores data in memory for faster access|Redis, Memcached|
|Distributed Database|Data stored across multiple physical locations|Google Bigtable, Amazon DynamoDB|
|Cloud Database|Hosted on cloud services|Google Cloud SQL, Amazon RDS|

### Code Example: SQL Query in a Relational Database

            SELECT first_name, last_name, age 
            FROM students 
            WHERE age > 18;
        

In this query:

- `first_name`, `last_name`, and `age` are columns in the `students` table.
- The `WHERE` clause filters records to return only those where age is greater than 18.

## 5. Characteristics of a Database

|Characteristic|Description|
|---|---|
|Data Integrity|Ensures data accuracy and consistency|
|Data Security|Protects data from unauthorized access or corruption|
|Concurrent Access|Allows multiple users to access data simultaneously|
|Data Independence|Changes in data storage do not affect data access methods|
|Scalability|Ability to handle increasing amounts of data|

In summary:

- **Data** is raw, unprocessed facts.
- **Information** is meaningful and organized data.
- A **database** efficiently stores, manages, and retrieves data, with key characteristics like data integrity, security, and scalability.
