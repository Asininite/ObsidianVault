# STEPS
## 1. Reduction of CFG

## 2. Removal of Unit Productions

## 3. Removal of Null Productions

### phase 1 
- remove the variables(or non terminals) that don't have any production rule
- T = {set of terminal symbols}
- W = {set of non-terminal symbols that can derive the set of T}
### phase 2 
- remove the variables and terminals that are non reachable from any variable
