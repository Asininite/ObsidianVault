Show the equivalence classes of Canonical Myhill-Nerode relation for the language of binary string which starts with I and ends with 0

### Equivalence Classes of Canonical Myhill-Nerode Relation

The Canonical Myhill-Nerode relation for a language consists of equivalence classes, where two strings are equivalent if and only if the same set of strings can follow them to form strings in the language.

For the language of binary strings that start with 1 and end with 0, the equivalence classes can be determined as follows:

1. Strings ending with 0 are in the same equivalence class.

- Equivalence class 1: {10, 110, 1110, ...}
- Equivalence class 2: {010, 0110, 01110, ...}
- Equivalence class 3: {0010, 00110, 001110, ...}
- And so on.

2. Strings not ending with 0 are in their own equivalence classes.

- Equivalence class 4: {1, 11, 111, ...}
- Equivalence class 5: {101, 1001, 10001, ...}
- Equivalence class 6: {1001, 10001, 100001, ...}
- And so on.

These equivalence classes represent the distinct "states" or "positions" in the Myhill-Nerode automaton for the given language.
