The pumping lemma states that if a language 𝐿 is regular, then there exists a constant 𝑝 (the pumping length) such that any string 𝑠 in 𝐿 where the length of 𝑠 is greater than or equal to 𝑝, can be divided into three parts 𝑥𝑦𝑧

. The following conditions must be true:
- For each i≥0, i is greater than or equal to 0
    𝑖 ≥ 0, 𝑥 𝑦^𝑖 𝑧 is in 𝐿    
    |y| > 0
    |𝑥𝑦| ≤ 𝑝
