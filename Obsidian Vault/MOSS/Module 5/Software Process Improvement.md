# SPI
The SPI strategy transforms the existing approach to software development into something that is more focused, more repeatable, and more reliable.
- 1. Assessment and Gap Analysis
	  assess strengths and weaknesses in how the organization applies the software processes
	  difference between local application and best practice leaves a 'gap' 
	  gap provides opportunities for improvement
- 2. Education and Training
	  education and training for practitioners, technical managers and senior managers
	  generic software engineering concepts
	  specific technology and tools
	  communication and quality-oriented topics
- 3. Selection and Justification
	  after initial assessment, software org begins to make decisions
	  decide which frameworks will be used
	  which work products get made
	  decide on the quality assurance checkpoints
- 4. Installation and Migration
	  first point where the organization feels the effects of implemented changes
	  
- 5. Evaluation
	  assesses the degree to which the changes have been instantiated and adopted
	  the degree to which such changes result in better software quality
	  overall status of the processes
- 6. Risk Management
	  should manage risk at three points
		  prior to instantiation of SPI road map
