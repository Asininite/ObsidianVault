### Reuse
- abstraction level
	  don't reuse software directly
	  use knowledge of successful abstractions in design of the product software
	  aka we use the idea of the code
- object level
	  we reuse objects from a library instead of writing it ourselves
	  think nodejs, and we use that as a library
- component level 
	  components are collections of objects and object classes 
	  we need to extend this component by adding our own code
	  then it will work
- system level
	  we reuse entire application systems
	  configuration is needed, by adding our own code
	  OR 
	  by using the systems own configurator
	  think anti-cheat software, and how we use it as a whole
