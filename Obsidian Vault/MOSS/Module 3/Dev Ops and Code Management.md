SINGLE TEAM DOING DEVELOPMENT + DEPLOYMENT + SUPPORT


### Principles
- EVERYONE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING : 
	  all team members have joint responsibility developing, deploying and supporting the software
- EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE AUTOMATED IS AUTOMATED : 
	  minimal manual involvement
	  developing, deploying, supporting should be automated
- MEASURE FIRST, CHANGE LATER :
	  collect data about the operations then change processes and tools

### Benefits 
- Faster Deployment 
	  software can be quickly deployed because communication delays are lesser
- Reduced Risks
	  there is less change in functionality, so less risk
- Faster Repair
	  since teams work together, its easier to find the issue and solve it 
- More Productive Teams
	  teams are happier

### DEVOPS AUTOMATION
- continuous integration 
	  everytime a developer makes a change to the project master branch, a version of the system is created and tested
	  I git commit, then a new version is executed and tested
- continuous delivery
	  simulation of the products operating environment is created and the software is tested
	  a VM for windows is made and my thingie is tested there
- continuous deployment
	  everytime a change made, a new version is made available
	  I git commit, new version is available
