### Categories of Risk
- Project Risks
	  affect project schedule or resources 
	  example if an architect dies, we need to find a replacement and the project may be on hold till we find one
- Product Risks
	  affect quality and performance of the developed product
	  failure of a purchased component. If something we buy to use fails to meet our expectations that is a product risk
- Business Risks
	  These are risks that affect our business and profit margins
	  suppose a rival company releases a better product, this can ruin our sales, set the bar higher and force us to make better products from now on
