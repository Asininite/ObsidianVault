# Stages
1. **Planning and Feasibility Study:**
    - **Goal:** Determine if the project is viable and worth pursuing. Define the problem and scope.
    - **Activities:** Identify the need/opportunity, define high-level goals, conduct initial requirements gathering, perform feasibility studies (technical, economic, operational, schedule - TEOS), estimate resources, assess risks, get project approval.
    - **Deliverable:** Feasibility report, project plan outline, initial scope definition.

2. **Analysis / Requirements Definition:**    
    - **Goal:** Understand and document what the system must do in detail. Define user needs precisely.
    - **Activities:** Gather detailed functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders (interviews, surveys, observation), analyze existing systems, model business processes, analyze data requirements.
    - **Deliverable:** Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, use cases, data models. This is often considered the most critical phase.

3. **Design:**    
    - **Goal:** Determine how the system will be built to meet the specified requirements. Create the technical blueprint.
    - **Activities:** Define the overall system architecture, design modules/components, specify interfaces between components, design databases, design user interfaces (UI) and user experience (UX), select technologies (programming languages, platforms). Divided into High-Level Design (architecture) and Low-Level Design (module specifics).
    - **Deliverable:** Design specification documents, architecture diagrams, database schema, UI mockups/prototypes.

4. **Implementation / Development / Coding:**    
    - **Goal:** Build the actual system based on the design specifications.
    - **Activities:** Write the code, create databases, install necessary hardware/software environments, perform unit testing (testing individual code components).
    - **Deliverable:** Working code modules, compiled software, unit test results.

5. **Testing:**    
    - **Goal:** Verify that the developed system meets the requirements defined in the Analysis phase and works correctly according to the Design. Find and fix defects.
    - **Activities:**
        - Integration Testing: Test interfaces between modules.
        - System Testing: Test the entire system as a whole.
        - Performance Testing: Check speed, reliability, load handling.
        - Security Testing: Identify vulnerabilities.
        - User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Users test the system to confirm it meets their needs in a real-world scenario.
    - **Deliverable:** Test plans, test cases, bug reports, test summary report, user acceptance sign-off.

6. **Deployment / Installation:**    
    - **Goal:** Make the system operational for end-users. Put the system into production.
    - **Activities:** Install the software/hardware in the production environment, data migration/conversion from old systems, user training, finalize documentation. Deployment strategies can vary (e.g., direct cutover, parallel adoption, phased rollout).
    - **Deliverable:** Operational system, user documentation, training materials.

7. **Maintenance / Operation:**    
    - **Goal:** Keep the system running smoothly and adapt it to changing needs over its lifespan. This is often the longest phase.
    - **Activities:** Ongoing user support, monitoring system performance, bug fixing (corrective maintenance), adding minor enhancements (adaptive maintenance), improving performance or maintainability (perfective maintenance), system updates, backups, eventual decommissioning.
    - **Deliverable:** Updated documentation, bug fixes, enhancement releases, performance reports.
