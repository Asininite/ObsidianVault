- **Dynamic Address Translation (DAT)** is the **hardware-based process** of converting a **virtual address** (generated by the CPU during program execution) into a corresponding **physical address** (the actual location in main memory/RAM) **at runtime**.

The most common way DAT is implemented today is through **Paging**:

1. **Address Space Division:** Both the program's virtual address space and the physical RAM are divided into fixed-size blocks:
    
    - **Pages:** Blocks of virtual memory (e.g., 4KB).
        
    - **Frames:** Blocks of physical memory (same size as pages).
        
2. **Virtual Address Structure:** A virtual address generated by the CPU is typically split into two parts:
    
    - **Virtual Page Number (VPN):** Identifies which page the address belongs to.
        
    - **Offset:** The byte location within that page.
        
    - Virtual Address = [Virtual Page Number | Offset]
        
3. **Page Tables:** The Operating System maintains a data structure called a **page table** for each running process. This table maps the process's Virtual Page Numbers (VPNs) to the Physical Frame Numbers (PFNs) where those pages are currently located in RAM.
    
    - Page Table Entry (PTE) contains: PFN, plus control bits (Valid, Protection, Dirty, etc.).
        
4. **MMU Translation Process:**
    
    - The CPU generates a virtual address.
        
    - The MMU extracts the VPN and the Offset.
        
    - The MMU uses the VPN to look up the corresponding entry in the current process's page table (the OS tells the MMU where this table is via a special register, like CR3 on x86).
        
    - The MMU retrieves the Physical Frame Number (PFN) from the Page Table Entry (PTE).
        
    - The MMU checks control bits (e.g., is the page valid/present in RAM? Does the access violate protection rules?). If checks fail, it triggers a fault/exception to the OS.
        
    - If checks pass, the MMU combines the PFN with the original Offset to form the **Physical Address**.  
        Physical Address = [Physical Frame Number | Offset]
        
    - The MMU sends this physical address to the RAM controller.
