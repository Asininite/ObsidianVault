In CPU classification we have Stack CPU. In stack CPU both the operands are present in the stack memory and after ALU operation are further kept the output in the stack memory. So it use storage to storage instruction.  
  
For example:  
  
I1: PUSH B.  
I2: PUSH X.  
I3: ADD.  
I4: POP C.  
  
Output is C = B+X.
