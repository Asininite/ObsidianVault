### Question 7:

**Out of these page replacement algorithms, which one suffers from Belady's anomaly?**
*   a) LRU
*   b) FIFO
*   c) Both LRU and FIFO
*   d) Optimal Page Replacement

**Answer:** b) FIFO

**Explanation:**

*   **Page Replacement Algorithms:** When a page fault occurs and there are no free frames in memory, the operating system must choose a page currently in memory to replace (swap out). Page replacement algorithms are the strategies used to make this selection.
*   **Belady's Anomaly:** This is a phenomenon where *increasing the number of page frames allocated to a process can, in some rare cases, lead to an increase in the number of page faults*. This is counter-intuitive because one would expect more memory to always result in fewer page faults.
*   **Algorithms and Belady's Anomaly:**
    *   **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):** This algorithm replaces the page that has been in memory the longest. FIFO is susceptible to Belady's Anomaly. This can happen because the page that has been in memory the longest might still be actively used, and replacing it leads to an immediate page fault for that page.
    *   **LRU (Least Recently Used):** This algorithm replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period. LRU does *not* suffer from Belady's Anomaly. LRU belongs to a class of algorithms called "stack algorithms" which inherently avoid this anomaly.
    *   **Optimal Page Replacement (OPT or MIN):** This algorithm replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period in the future. It's an optimal algorithm (causes the fewest page faults) but is impossible to implement in practice because it requires future knowledge. It also does not suffer from Belady's Anomaly and is a stack algorithm.
*   Therefore, FIFO is the algorithm among the choices that suffers from Belady's Anomaly.

### Question 8:

**Which one of these is NOT shared by the same process's threads?**
*   a) Address Space
*   b) Stack
*   c) Message Queue
*   d) File Descriptor Table

**Answer:** b) Stack

**Explanation:**

*   **Threads:** Threads are lightweight units of execution within a process. Multiple threads within the same process share many resources, which is what makes them efficient for concurrent programming.
*   **Shared Resources by Threads of the Same Process:**
    *   **Address Space:** All threads of a process share the same memory space (code segment, data segment, heap). This means they can access the same global variables.
    *   **Open Files (File Descriptor Table):** Threads within a process share the set of open files. If one thread opens a file, other threads in the same process can read from or write to that file using the same file descriptor.
    *   **Message Queues (and other IPC mechanisms):** Generally, IPC mechanisms like message queues, pipes, and semaphores are associated with the process and can be accessed by all threads within that process.
    *   **Global Variables:** Shared.
    *   **Heap Memory:** Shared.
    *   Child processes (if any).
    *   Signals and signal handlers.
    *   Accounting information.
*   **Resources Not Shared (or, Unique to Each Thread):**
    *   **Stack:** Each thread has its own private stack. The stack is used to store local variables, function call parameters, and return addresses for that thread. This is crucial for threads to execute independently.
    *   **Registers (including Program Counter - PC):** Each thread has its own set of registers to keep track of its execution state.
    *   **Thread ID:** Each thread has a unique identifier.
    *   **Thread-specific data (if any).**

### Question 9:

**Which of these disk scheduling policies results in minimum head movement?**
*   a) Circular scan
*   b) Elevator
*   c) FCS
*   d) None of the above

**Answer:** d) None of the above (with a nuance)

**Explanation:**

*   **Disk Scheduling Algorithms:** These algorithms are used by the operating system to decide the order in which to service disk I/O requests. The goal is usually to minimize seek time (head movement) and provide fairness.
    *   **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) also known as FCS:** Services requests in the order they arrive. It's simple but generally doesn't optimize head movement and can lead to poor performance.
    *   **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First):** Selects the request that requires the least head movement from its current position. It can minimize head movement significantly but may lead to starvation for requests far from the current head position. *This is generally the best for minimizing head movement in the short term, but it's not among the options directly as "SSTF".*
    *   **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm):** The disk arm moves in one direction (e.g., towards the innermost cylinder) servicing all requests in its path, then reverses direction and services requests in the other direction. This behaves like an elevator. It provides more balanced service than SSTF.
    *   **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN):** Similar to SCAN, but when the head reaches one end, it immediately returns to the beginning of the disk without servicing any requests on the return trip, then starts scanning in one direction again. This provides more uniform wait times.
    *   **LOOK and C-LOOK:** These are optimizations of SCAN and C-SCAN, respectively. The head only travels as far as the last request in each direction, rather than going to the very end of the disk.
*   **Comparing the given options for "minimum head movement":**
    *   **FCS/FCFS:** Definitely not optimal for head movement.
    *   **Elevator (SCAN) and Circular SCAN:** These are designed to be better than FCFS and provide more fairness than SSTF. They don't strictly guarantee *the absolute minimum* head movement in all scenarios like SSTF might achieve for a specific set of pending requests, but they are good at reducing overall head movement compared to FCFS.
*   **The nuance:** If the question implies which of the given options is *generally best* at reducing head movement while also considering fairness to some extent, SCAN and C-SCAN are good candidates. However, SSTF (not listed) is the one that greedily minimizes immediate head movement. Since SSTF is not an option, and the question asks for "minimum head movement" in a general sense, it's tricky.
    * If "minimum head movement" refers to a strategy specifically designed to achieve this over a batch of requests, SSTF is the answer. Since SSTF is missing, none of the listed definitively achieves the *absolute theoretical an* across all possible scenarios compared to what SSTF aims for.
    * However, in practice, SCAN and C-SCAN provide a good balance and significantly reduce head movement compared to FCFS.

    If we have to pick the *best among the given ones* for reducing head movement, both **Elevator (SCAN)** and **Circular SCAN** are much better than FCFS. There isn't always a clear winner between SCAN and C-SCAN in terms of *total* head movement; C-SCAN improves wait time uniformity.

    Given the typical understanding that SSTF is designed for minimizing head movement, and it is not listed, "None of the above" seems plausible if the question implies a strict "absolute minimum at all times." However, many exams would consider SCAN/C-SCAN as policies that *result in* reduced (if not always the strict theoretical minimum) head movement compared to FCFS.

Let's consider what answer is usually expected. In the absence of SSTF, SCAN ("Elevator") is a strong contender for reducing head movement.

Re-evaluating: "minimum head movement" is the key. While SSTF is often cited, among the given options, the **Elevator (SCAN)** algorithm is designed to reduce head movement by servicing all requests in one direction before reversing. C-SCAN also does this but has a quick return. FCFS is generally poor.

Let's assume "minimum" means "significantly reduced" rather than "the absolute minimum possible under all circumstances (which would be SSTF or LOOK/C-LOOK variants)."
Between SCAN and C-SCAN, SCAN would generally have slightly less total head movement than C-SCAN because C-SCAN has a fast return sweep from one end to the other without servicing requests.

Therefore, **b) Elevator** is the most likely intended answer if we are to choose the best among the given.

### Question 12:

**Given the following relation instance.**
x y z
1 4 2
1 5 3
1 6 3
3 2 2

**Identify the statement among the following that is FALSE.**
*   a) XY → Z and Z → Y
*   b) YZ → X and Y → Z
*   c) YZ → X and X → Z
*   d) XZ → Y and Y → X

To solve this, we need to check each functional dependency (FD) against the given data.
A functional dependency A → B means that for any two tuples in the relation, if they have the same value for attribute(s) A, they must also have the same value for attribute(s) B.

Let's examine the data:
t1: (x=1, y=4, z=2)
t2: (x=1, y=5, z=3)
t3: (x=1, y=6, z=3)
t4: (x=3, y=2, z=2)

**a) XY → Z and Z → Y**
*   **XY → Z:**
    *   (1,4) → 2
    *   (1,5) → 3
    *   (1,6) → 3
    *   (3,2) → 2
    All XY pairs are unique, so they trivially determine Z. (TRUE)
*   **Z → Y:**
    *   Does z=2 always imply the same y?
        *   t1: z=2, y=4
        *   t4: z=2, y=2
        Here, z=2 maps to y=4 and y=2. So Z → Y is FALSE.
    Since one part (Z → Y) is false, statement (a) as a whole claim (that *both* hold) is only true if *both* FDs hold. But Z -> Y is false from our check. The question asks for the FALSE statement *among the options*. So, if option 'a' means "The FD XY → Z holds AND the FD Z → Y holds", and we found Z → Y is false, then the combined statement "XY → Z and Z → Y" (interpreted as *both* being true) is FALSE. This looks like our answer. Let's verify the others.

**Let's re-evaluate the meaning of the options.** An option like "A and B" as a statement is true if and only if both A and B are true. If either A or B is false, the statement "A and B" is false.

Let's check each individual FD's truthfulness first.

*   **XY → Z:**
    *   (1,4) uniquely maps to 2.
    *   (1,5) uniquely maps to 3.
    *   (1,6) uniquely maps to 3.
    *   (3,2) uniquely maps to 2.
    Since all (X,Y) pairs are distinct, XY → Z is TRUE.

*   **Z → Y:**
    *   For z=2: we have y=4 (in t1) and y=2 (in t4). Different y's for the same z.
    So, **Z → Y is FALSE.**

*   **YZ → X:**
    *   (4,2) → 1
    *   (5,3) → 1
    *   (6,3) → 1
    *   (2,2) → 3
    Are there repeated YZ values?
        *   (y=5, z=3) maps to x=1 (t2)
        *   (y=6, z=3) maps to x=1 (t3)
    These are different YZ pairs. All YZ pairs are unique, so YZ → X is TRUE.

*   **Y → Z:**
    *   For y=4: z=2 (t1)
    *   For y=5: z=3 (t2)
    *   For y=6: z=3 (t3)
    *   For y=2: z=2 (t4)
    All y values are distinct in this dataset, so Y → Z is TRUE for this instance.

*   **X → Z:**
    *   For x=1: we have z=2 (t1), z=3 (t2), z=3 (t3). Different z's for the same x.
    So, **X → Z is FALSE.**

*   **XZ → Y:**
    *   (1,2) → 4 (t1)
    *   (1,3) → 5 (t2)
    *   (1,3) → 6 (t3)
    Here, for XZ = (1,3), we have y=5 and y=6. Different y's for the same XZ.
    So, **XZ → Y is FALSE.**

*   **Y → X:**
    *   y=4 → x=1
    *   y=5 → x=1
    *   y=6 → x=1
    *   y=2 → x=3
    All y values are distinct, so Y → X is TRUE for this instance.

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **a) XY → Z (TRUE) and Z → Y (FALSE)**
    Statement "TRUE and FALSE" is **FALSE**.

*   **b) YZ → X (TRUE) and Y → Z (TRUE)**
    Statement "TRUE and TRUE" is **TRUE**.

*   **c) YZ → X (TRUE) and X → Z (FALSE)**
    Statement "TRUE and FALSE" is **FALSE**.

*   **d) XZ → Y (FALSE) and Y → X (TRUE)**
    Statement "FALSE and TRUE" is **FALSE**.

The question asks to "Identify the statement among the following that is FALSE."
We have found three statements (a, c, d) that are FALSE. This implies there might be an error in my FD derivations or in the question/options, as usually there's only one "most false" or one definitively false option in such MCQs.

Let's re-check the FDs meticulously.
Data:
t1: (x=1, y=4, z=2)
t2: (x=1, y=5, z=3)
t3: (x=1, y=6, z=3)
t4: (x=3, y=2, z=2)

FD Checks:
1.  **XY → Z**:
    (1,4) → 2
    (1,5) → 3
    (1,6) → 3
    (3,2) → 2
    No conflict. XY determines Z. **TRUE**.

2.  **Z → Y**:
    z=2: y=4 (t1), y=2 (t4). Conflict. Z does not determine Y. **FALSE**.

3.  **YZ → X**:
    (4,2) → 1
    (5,3) → 1
    (6,3) → 1
    (2,2) → 3
    No conflict. YZ determines X. **TRUE**.

4.  **Y → Z**:
    y=4 → z=2
    y=5 → z=3
    y=6 → z=3
    y=2 → z=2
    No occurrences of the same Y having different Z. **TRUE**.

5.  **X → Z**:
    x=1: z=2 (t1), z=3 (t2), z=3 (t3). Conflict (1→2 and 1→3). X does not determine Z. **FALSE**.

6.  **XZ → Y**:
    (1,2) → y=4 (t1)
    (1,3) → y=5 (t2)
    (1,3) → y=6 (t3)
    Conflict for XZ=(1,3). XZ does not determine Y. **FALSE**.

7.  **Y → X**:
    y=4 → x=1
    y=5 → x=1
    y=6 → x=1
    y=2 → x=3
    No occurrences of the same Y having different X. **TRUE**.

Now, re-evaluate the options:
*   **a) XY → Z (TRUE) and Z → Y (FALSE)**. The statement "TRUE and FALSE" is **FALSE**.
*   **b) YZ → X (TRUE) and Y → Z (TRUE)**. The statement "TRUE and TRUE" is **TRUE**.
*   **c) YZ → X (TRUE) and X → Z (FALSE)**. The statement "TRUE and FALSE" is **FALSE**.
*   **d) XZ → Y (FALSE) and Y → X (TRUE)**. The statement "FALSE and TRUE" is **FALSE**.

This is problematic. If the question asks for *the* statement that is FALSE, and there are three false statements, there's an issue.
Possibilities:
1.  An error in my understanding of how to evaluate the "statement".
2.  An error in my FD checking (double-checked, seems okay).
3.  The question implies something else, like some FDs are given and we have to find a property that is false among the combined set. (Unlikely wording for that).
4.  There's an error in the question or options provided in the exam. This happens.

Let's consider if the "and" might be interpreted differently.
Could it be that "Statement: FD1 and FD2" means we are checking if both FD1 and FD2 *must necessarily hold* based on some underlying schema, not just the instance? But the question says "Given the following relation instance." so it's instance-based.

What if Z → Y was typo and should be Z → X or something else?

Let's assume the question is valid and I need to find a unique false statement.
Perhaps the "statement" refers to the overall assertion, and only one option results in a FALSE overall assertion.

Is it possible that the question is specifically asking about non-trivial FDs? All these look potentially non-trivial.

If the question means "Which of these lines contains at least one false functional dependency assertion?", then (a), (c), and (d) all contain at least one false FD.

If an option like "FD1 and FD2" is a statement, then the statement is false if *at least one* FD is false or if *both* are false. The statement is true *only if both* FDs are true.

So, the task is to find which of the *compound statements* (a, b, c, d) is FALSE.
*   a) XY → Z (T) **and** Z → Y (F)  =>  T and F  => **FALSE**
*   b) YZ → X (T) **and** Y → Z (T)  =>  T and T  => **TRUE**
*   c) YZ → X (T) **and** X → Z (F)  =>  T and F  => **FALSE**
*   d) XZ → Y (F) **and** Y → X (T)  =>  F and T  => **FALSE**

Still, options a, c, and d are FALSE. This means there could be an error in the question.
However, in a multiple-choice test, if there are multiple technically correct answers for "which is false", there might be one that is "more directly" or "more obviously" false, or perhaps I misinterpreted something subtle.

Let's look at them again.
a) Z → Y is clearly violated: (t1: z=2, y=4) vs (t4: z=2, y=2).
c) X → Z is clearly violated: (t1: x=1, z=2) vs (t2: x=1, z=3).
d) XZ → Y is clearly violated: (t2: x=1,z=3 → y=5) vs (t3: x=1,z=3 → y=6).

All these violations are direct and simple.

Could there be a typo in my transcription of the data or the options?
x y z
1 4 2 (t1)
1 5 3 (t2)
1 6 3 (t3)
3 2 2 (t4)

a) XY → Z and Z → Y
b) YZ → X and Y → Z
c) YZ → X and X → Z
d) XZ → Y and Y → X

The analysis seems correct so far, leading to three false options.
In an exam setting, if faced with this, I would re-check my work. If confident, I'd suspect an error in the question.

If the question were "Identify the statement among the following that is TRUE", then (b) would be the clear answer.
Since it asks for FALSE, and a, c, d are all false:

Let's assume there is a single answer. What could make one FD "more false" or one compound statement uniquely false?
This does not seem to be the case here; the logic for "A and B" being false is straightforward.

Could it be about minimal FDs or something? No indication.

Let's pick one that seems direct. For (a), Z → Y is false due to (1,4,2) and (3,2,2). The XY→Z part is true.
For (c), X → Z is false due to (1,4,2) and (1,5,3). The YZ→X part is true.
For (d), XZ → Y is false due to (1,5,3) and (1,6,3). The Y→X part is true.

There 's no distinguishing feature.
Perhaps the question expected us to check the *first* part of the "and" statement, and if false, mark the whole thing false, or check the second part. This seems unlikely.

Let me search if there's any subtlety in evaluating combined FDs like this. Usually, "A and B" means both must hold for the statement to be true.
It's a standard logic.

Perhaps the question intends to ask "Which functional dependency listed in the options is false?" but is poorly worded.
If Z → Y is false, then statement (a) is false.
If X → Z is false, then statement (c) is false.
If XZ → Y is false, then statement (d) is false.

Let's assume, for the sake of getting *an* answer for a typical exam scenario, that there's no error in my method and there might indeed be an error in the question where multiple options are false. If forced to pick only one, there's no logical basis to prefer one over the others from a, c, d.

However, if this were a "select all that apply" that were false, a, c, and d would be it. Since it's MCQ implyng a single answer, this is problematic.

Let's go back to the basics. Statement (b) is TRUE. So, if the question is correct and has ONE false statement, then my analysis of (b) being true must be correct.
YZ -> X (TRUE), Y -> Z (TRUE). So (b) is TRUE.

If the question "Identify the statement among the following that is FALSE" is well-posed, and only one answer is expected to be false, then my analysis that a, c, and d are ALL false must have an error. Let me re-check the TRUE ones.

XY → Z:
(1,4)→2
(1,5)→3
(1,6)→3
(3,2)→2
This is TRUE.

Z → Y:
z=2: y=4 (t1), y=2 (t4). **FALSE.**

YZ → X:
(4,2)→1
(5,3)→1
(6,3)→1
(2,2)→3
This is TRUE.

Y → Z:
y=4→z=2
y=5→z=3
y=6→z=3
y=2→z=2
This is TRUE.

X → Z:
x=1: z=2 (t1), z=3 (t2). **FALSE.**

XZ → Y:
(1,2)→y=4
(1,3)→y=5 (t2), y=6 (t3). **FALSE.**

Y → X:
y=4→x=1
y=5→x=1
y=6→x=1
y=2→x=3
This is TRUE.

Re-evaluating options:
a) XY → Z (T) and Z → Y (F). Result: **FALSE**.
b) YZ → X (T) and Y → Z (T). Result: **TRUE**.
c) YZ → X (T) and X → Z (F). Result: **FALSE**.
d) XZ → Y (F) and Y → X (T). Result: **FALSE**.

My analysis consistently shows (b) is TRUE, and (a), (c), (d) are FALSE.
Given that this is an exam question, there must be a single FALSE statement if it's phrased as "Identify the statement...that is FALSE".
This leads to a strong suspicion of an error in the question itself or the provided options, or I am missing a very specific convention.

If the question instead was "Identify the statement among the following that is TRUE", then **(b)** would be the answer.
Given the question asks for the FALSE statement, and I identify three, let's select one of them. There's no further criterion provided. I'll pick (a) as the first one I determined to be false. But this is arbitrary.

Assuming this is a typical exam question style where there is one correct answer, and my analysis shows three options are false and one is true (option b), then the question "Identify the statement... that is FALSE" is problematic. If the question *actually* meant to ask "Identify the statement... that is TRUE", then (b) is the answer.

If we absolutely must pick a FALSE one according to the question as written, any of (a), (c), or (d) would be valid. I'll stick with (a) because Z→Y being false is a very clear violation.

Final decision for Q12: Assuming the question is "Identify the statement among the following that is FALSE", then (a), (c), and (d) are all false. If there's a single intended answer, the question is flawed. If I must pick one of the false ones, I'll pick (a).

This kind of ambiguity is frustrating in exams. What if one of the TRUE FDs I found is actually false on closer inspection allowing one of b,c or d to become TRUE?
Let's re-check the "TRUE" FDs:
XY → Z: Distinct (X,Y) pairs ensure this is true for this instance.
YZ → X: Distinct (Y,Z) pairs ensure this is true for this instance.
Y → Z: Distinct Y values ensure this is true for this instance.
Y → X: Distinct Y values ensure this is true for this instance.

My assessment of individual FDs for the given instance seems robust. The issue is that three options evaluate to FALSE. This often happens in poorly set questions. If the solution key says, for example, (c) is the answer, it doesn't invalidate that (a) and (d) are also false.

Given the structure of such questions, they usually look for a unique answer. The only unique evaluation here is that statement (b) is TRUE. Perhaps the question is a typo and should be "Identify the statement... that is TRUE"? If so, (b) is the choice. If it is indeed "FALSE", then the question is flawed. For now, I will provide answers based on the question as written and note the ambiguity.

**Question 40: Consider a B+ tree with order 4. What is the maximum number of keys that can be stored in a node?**
*   **Answer:** b) 3
*   **Core Concept: B+ Tree Order**
    *   The **order `p`** of a B+ tree (sometimes denoted `m`) defines the maximum number of *children* an internal node can have.
    *   An internal node with `p` children has `p-1` keys.
    *   A leaf node also typically holds up to `p-1` keys (or `p-1` data records/pointers depending on the B+ tree variant).
    *   If order is 4 (meaning max 4 children for internal nodes), then the maximum number of keys in any node (internal or leaf) is `order - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.
    *   Minimum keys in an internal node (except root) is `ceil(p/2) - 1`.
    *   Minimum keys in a leaf node (except root if it's also a leaf) is `floor(p/2)` or `ceil(p/2)-1` depending on definition.
