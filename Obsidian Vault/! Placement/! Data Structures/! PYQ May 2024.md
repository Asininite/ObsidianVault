Okay, I can help you with that! This looks like an exam paper for a Comprehensive Course Work in Computer Science and Engineering, likely focusing on topics from Operating Systems, Database Management Systems, Computer Networks, and Theory of Computation/Compiler Design.

Let's go through the questions one by one. I'll provide the answer and an explanation of the concepts involved, along with related topics you might find helpful for similar questions.

First, I'll need to use a search tool to ensure the explanations are accurate and cover the necessary details.

Okay, let's start with the first set of questions from Page 1.

### Question 1:

**In a timesharing operating system, when the time slot assigned to a process is completed, the process switches from the current state to?**
*   a) Suspended state
*   b) Terminated state
*   c) Ready state
*   d) Blocked state

**Answer:** c) Ready state

**Explanation:**

*   **Timesharing Operating Systems:** These systems allow multiple users or processes to share the CPU's time. Each process is allocated a small unit of CPU time called a "time slice" or "quantum".
*   **Process States:** Processes in an operating system go through various states:
    *   **New:** The process is being created.
    *   **Ready:** The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor. Ready processes are in main memory.
    *   **Running:** Instructions are being executed.
    *   **Waiting (or Blocked):** The process is waiting for some event to occur (such as I/O completion or receiving a signal).
    *   **Terminated:** The process has finished execution.
    *   **Suspended:** A process that was in memory (Ready or Blocked) is temporarily removed from main memory (swapped out) to secondary storage, often to free up memory. It will return to a Ready or Blocked state (in memory) when it's swapped back in.
*   **How it works:** When a process is running and its allocated time slice expires, the operating system's scheduler will preempt the current process if it hasn't finished. The process is then moved to the **Ready state**. It's not terminated because it hasn't finished. It's not blocked because it's not waiting for an external event (like I/O). It's not necessarily suspended unless there's a need for memory management to swap it out. It goes to the Ready state to wait for its next turn to use the CPU.

### Question 2:

**Dirty bit is used to indicate which of the following?**
*   a) A page fault has occurred
*   b) A page has corrupted data
*   c) A page has been modified after being loaded into cache
*   d) An illegal access of page

**Answer:** c) A page has been modified after being loaded into cache

**Explanation:**

*   **Dirty Bit (or Modified Bit):** A dirty bit is a flag associated with a block of computer memory (like a page in virtual memory or a cache line).
*   **Purpose:** It indicates whether the corresponding block of memory has been altered (written to) since it was loaded from a slower storage (like a hard disk into RAM, or RAM into CPU cache).
    *   If the dirty bit is set (e.g., to 1), it means the data in the cache/memory is newer than the data in the backing store. Therefore, before this page or cache line is replaced, its contents must be written back to the backing store to ensure data consistency.
    *   If the dirty bit is not set (e.g., to 0), it means the data has not been modified, and the copy in the backing store is still up-to-date. So, the page/cache line can be overwritten without writing it back, which saves time.
*   **Incorrect options:**
    *   **a) A page fault has occurred:** A page fault occurs when a program tries to access a page that is not currently in main memory. While handling a page fault might involve checking a dirty bit (if a page needs to be swapped out to make space), the dirty bit itself doesn't indicate the page fault.
    *   **b) A page has corrupted data:** A dirty bit only indicates modification, not corruption. Data corruption is a different issue.
    *   **d) An illegal access of page:** Illegal memory access (like trying to write to a read-only page or accessing a protected memory area) would typically result in a segmentation fault or protection fault, not just setting a dirty bit.

### Question 3:

**What is a short-term scheduler?**
*   a) It selects which process has to be brought into the ready queue
*   b) It selects which process has to be executed next and allocates CPU
*   c) It selects which process to remove from memory by swapping
*   d) None of the mentioned

**Answer:** b) It selects which process has to be executed next and allocates CPU

**Explanation:**

Operating systems often use different schedulers for different purposes:

*   **Long-Term Scheduler (or Job Scheduler):** This scheduler decides which processes from a job pool (on disk) should be brought into the main memory (ready queue) for execution. It controls the degree of multiprogramming (the number of processes in memory).
*   **Short-Term Scheduler (or CPU Scheduler):** This scheduler selects one of the processes that are already in the ready queue (in main memory) and allocates the CPU to it. This scheduler is invoked very frequently (e.g., on clock interrupts, I/O interrupts, or system calls).
*   **Medium-Term Scheduler:** This scheduler is involved in swapping processes out of main memory and into secondary storage (and vice-versa). This can be done to reduce the degree of multiprogramming or to free up memory. A swapped-out process is typically in a suspended state.

Therefore:
*   Option (a) describes the Long-Term Scheduler.
*   Option (c) describes the Medium-Term Scheduler (related to swapping).

### Question 4:

**If a process fails, most operating system write the error information to a \_**
*   a) new file
*   b) another running process
*   c) log file
*   d) none of the mentioned

**Answer:** c) log file

**Explanation:**

*   **Error Logging:** When errors, exceptions, or significant events occur within an application or the operating system itself, this information is typically recorded in log files.
*   **Purpose of Log Files:** These logs provide valuable information for troubleshooting, debugging, performance analysis, and security auditing. They can capture details like timestamps, error messages, stack traces (where in the code the error occurred), and other contextual information.
*   **Types of Logs:**
    *   **System Logs:** Generated by the OS, capturing hardware failures, OS-level crashes, etc.
    *   **Application Logs:** Track errors within specific applications.
*   **How it works:** When an OS module detects an error, it sends error information to a logging facility (like `errsave` or `errlog` in some systems, or `syslog` on Linux). A daemon (like `errdemon`) might then process this information and write it to a designated error log file.
*   **Incorrect options:**
    *   **a) new file:** While an error might *incidentally* be written to a new file in some very specific custom scenarios, the standard practice is to append to or manage existing, designated log files. Creating a brand new file for every single error isn't typical.
    *   **b) another running process:** While inter-process communication is possible, directly writing error information to *another random running process* as a primary error recording mechanism is not standard or reliable. Some logging systems might involve a dedicated logging process, but the persistent record is a file.

### Question 5:

**If a process is executing in its critical section, then no other processes can be executing in their critical section. What is this condition called?**
*   a) mutual exclusion
*   b) critical exclusion
*   c) synchronous exclusion
*   d) asynchronous exclusion

**Answer:** a) mutual exclusion

**Explanation:**

*   **Critical Section:** A critical section is a segment of code in a process where shared resources (like shared variables, files, or data structures) are accessed.
*   **Race Condition:** If multiple processes access and manipulate shared data concurrently, and the outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access takes place, it's called a race condition. Race conditions can lead to unpredictable results and data corruption.
*   **Mutual Exclusion:** To prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity, only one process should be allowed to execute in its critical section (that accesses a particular shared resource) at any given time. This fundamental requirement is called **mutual exclusion**. If a process is in its critical section, other processes that want to enter their critical sections (for the same resource) must wait.
*   **Other options:**
    *   "Critical exclusion," "synchronous exclusion," and "asynchronous exclusion" are not standard terms for this specific condition. Mutual exclusion is the widely accepted term.

### Question 6:

**When are the register context and stack of thread deallocated?**
*   a) when the thread terminates
*   b) when the thread blocks
*   c) when the thread unblocks
*   d) when the thread spawns

**Answer:** a) when the thread terminates

**Explanation:**

*   **Thread Context:** Each thread has its own execution context, which includes its program counter (PC), a set of registers, and its own stack. The stack is used for local variables, function call parameters, and return addresses for that specific thread.
*   **Thread Lifecycle:** Threads go through various states, similar to processes (e.g., ready, running, blocked, terminated).
*   **Deallocation of Resources:**
    *   **When a thread terminates** (either by completing its execution or being explicitly killed), the operating system reclaims the resources allocated to it. This includes deallocating its stack and releasing its register context so that these resources can be used by other threads or processes.
    *   **When a thread blocks** (e.g., waiting for I/O), its state changes, and it stops executing, but its context (registers, stack) must be preserved so it can resume execution later when the blocking condition is resolved. These resources are not deallocated.
    *   **When a thread unblocks**, it moves from a waiting state to a ready state. Its context is still intact.
    *   **When a thread spawns** (creates another thread), the new thread gets its own context and stack allocated. The spawning thread's resources are not deallocated.

Okay, let's move on to the questions on Page 2.

### Question 7:

**Out of these page replacement algorithms, which one suffers from Belady's anomaly?**
*   a) LRU
*   b) FIFO
*   c) Both LRU and FIFO
*   d) Optimal Page Replacement

**Answer:** b) FIFO

**Explanation:**

*   **Page Replacement Algorithms:** When a page fault occurs and there are no free frames in memory, the operating system must choose a page currently in memory to replace (swap out). Page replacement algorithms are the strategies used to make this selection.
*   **Belady's Anomaly:** This is a phenomenon where *increasing the number of page frames allocated to a process can, in some rare cases, lead to an increase in the number of page faults*. This is counter-intuitive because one would expect more memory to always result in fewer page faults.
*   **Algorithms and Belady's Anomaly:**
    *   **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):** This algorithm replaces the page that has been in memory the longest. FIFO is susceptible to Belady's Anomaly. This can happen because the page that has been in memory the longest might still be actively used, and replacing it leads to an immediate page fault for that page.
    *   **LRU (Least Recently Used):** This algorithm replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period. LRU does *not* suffer from Belady's Anomaly. LRU belongs to a class of algorithms called "stack algorithms" which inherently avoid this anomaly.
    *   **Optimal Page Replacement (OPT or MIN):** This algorithm replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period in the future. It's an optimal algorithm (causes the fewest page faults) but is impossible to implement in practice because it requires future knowledge. It also does not suffer from Belady's Anomaly and is a stack algorithm.
*   Therefore, FIFO is the algorithm among the choices that suffers from Belady's Anomaly.

### Question 8:

**Which one of these is NOT shared by the same process's threads?**
*   a) Address Space
*   b) Stack
*   c) Message Queue
*   d) File Descriptor Table

**Answer:** b) Stack

**Explanation:**

*   **Threads:** Threads are lightweight units of execution within a process. Multiple threads within the same process share many resources, which is what makes them efficient for concurrent programming.
*   **Shared Resources by Threads of the Same Process:**
    *   **Address Space:** All threads of a process share the same memory space (code segment, data segment, heap). This means they can access the same global variables.
    *   **Open Files (File Descriptor Table):** Threads within a process share the set of open files. If one thread opens a file, other threads in the same process can read from or write to that file using the same file descriptor.
    *   **Message Queues (and other IPC mechanisms):** Generally, IPC mechanisms like message queues, pipes, and semaphores are associated with the process and can be accessed by all threads within that process.
    *   **Global Variables:** Shared.
    *   **Heap Memory:** Shared.
    *   Child processes (if any).
    *   Signals and signal handlers.
    *   Accounting information.
*   **Resources Not Shared (or, Unique to Each Thread):**
    *   **Stack:** Each thread has its own private stack. The stack is used to store local variables, function call parameters, and return addresses for that thread. This is crucial for threads to execute independently.
    *   **Registers (including Program Counter - PC):** Each thread has its own set of registers to keep track of its execution state.
    *   **Thread ID:** Each thread has a unique identifier.
    *   **Thread-specific data (if any).**

### Question 9:

**Which of these disk scheduling policies results in minimum head movement?**
*   a) Circular scan
*   b) Elevator
*   c) FCS
*   d) None of the above

**Answer:** d) None of the above (with a nuance)

**Explanation:**

*   **Disk Scheduling Algorithms:** These algorithms are used by the operating system to decide the order in which to service disk I/O requests. The goal is usually to minimize seek time (head movement) and provide fairness.
    *   **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) also known as FCS:** Services requests in the order they arrive. It's simple but generally doesn't optimize head movement and can lead to poor performance.
    *   **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First):** Selects the request that requires the least head movement from its current position. It can minimize head movement significantly but may lead to starvation for requests far from the current head position. *This is generally the best for minimizing head movement in the short term, but it's not among the options directly as "SSTF".*
    *   **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm):** The disk arm moves in one direction (e.g., towards the innermost cylinder) servicing all requests in its path, then reverses direction and services requests in the other direction. This behaves like an elevator. It provides more balanced service than SSTF.
    *   **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN):** Similar to SCAN, but when the head reaches one end, it immediately returns to the beginning of the disk without servicing any requests on the return trip, then starts scanning in one direction again. This provides more uniform wait times.
    *   **LOOK and C-LOOK:** These are optimizations of SCAN and C-SCAN, respectively. The head only travels as far as the last request in each direction, rather than going to the very end of the disk.
*   **Comparing the given options for "minimum head movement":**
    *   **FCS/FCFS:** Definitely not optimal for head movement.
    *   **Elevator (SCAN) and Circular SCAN:** These are designed to be better than FCFS and provide more fairness than SSTF. They don't strictly guarantee *the absolute minimum* head movement in all scenarios like SSTF might achieve for a specific set of pending requests, but they are good at reducing overall head movement compared to FCFS.
*   **The nuance:** If the question implies which of the given options is *generally best* at reducing head movement while also considering fairness to some extent, SCAN and C-SCAN are good candidates. However, SSTF (not listed) is the one that greedily minimizes immediate head movement. Since SSTF is not an option, and the question asks for "minimum head movement" in a general sense, it's tricky.
    * If "minimum head movement" refers to a strategy specifically designed to achieve this over a batch of requests, SSTF is the answer. Since SSTF is missing, none of the listed definitively achieves the *absolute theoretical an* across all possible scenarios compared to what SSTF aims for.
    * However, in practice, SCAN and C-SCAN provide a good balance and significantly reduce head movement compared to FCFS.

    If we have to pick the *best among the given ones* for reducing head movement, both **Elevator (SCAN)** and **Circular SCAN** are much better than FCFS. There isn't always a clear winner between SCAN and C-SCAN in terms of *total* head movement; C-SCAN improves wait time uniformity.

    Given the typical understanding that SSTF is designed for minimizing head movement, and it is not listed, "None of the above" seems plausible if the question implies a strict "absolute minimum at all times." However, many exams would consider SCAN/C-SCAN as policies that *result in* reduced (if not always the strict theoretical minimum) head movement compared to FCFS.

Let's consider what answer is usually expected. In the absence of SSTF, SCAN ("Elevator") is a strong contender for reducing head movement.

Re-evaluating: "minimum head movement" is the key. While SSTF is often cited, among the given options, the **Elevator (SCAN)** algorithm is designed to reduce head movement by servicing all requests in one direction before reversing. C-SCAN also does this but has a quick return. FCFS is generally poor.

Let's assume "minimum" means "significantly reduced" rather than "the absolute minimum possible under all circumstances (which would be SSTF or LOOK/C-LOOK variants)."
Between SCAN and C-SCAN, SCAN would generally have slightly less total head movement than C-SCAN because C-SCAN has a fast return sweep from one end to the other without servicing requests.

Therefore, **b) Elevator** is the most likely intended answer if we are to choose the best among the given.

### Question 10:

**In a computer system that consists of n number of CPUs, the maximum processes that can exist in the Ready State would be:**
*   a) Independent of n
*   b) 2n
*   c) n²
*   d) n

**Answer:** a) Independent of n

**Explanation:**

*   **Ready State:** Processes in the ready state are waiting to be assigned to a CPU for execution. They are already in main memory and have all the resources they need to run, except for the CPU itself.
*   **Number of CPUs (n):** The number of CPUs determines how many processes can be *simultaneously running* (one process per CPU, assuming single-threaded processes for simplicity here).
*   **Maximum Processes in Ready State:** The number of processes that *can be* in the ready state is limited by other factors, primarily:
    *   **Available Main Memory:** Each process in the ready queue consumes memory for its process control block (PCB) and its own address space (or at least parts of it). The total amount of available RAM will limit how many processes can reside in memory and thus be in the ready state.
    *   **Operating System Design Limits:** The OS might have configured limits on the maximum number of processes or threads it can manage, often related to the size of process tables or other kernel data structures.
*   The number of CPUs (n) dictates how many can *leave* the ready state and enter the running state at any given moment. It does not directly limit how many can *be waiting* in the ready state. The ready queue can, theoretically, hold many more processes than there are CPUs, as long as there's enough memory and the OS supports it.

Therefore, the maximum number of processes that can exist in the Ready State is primarily constrained by memory and OS limits, and is generally independent of 'n', the number of CPUs (as long as n is at least 1).

### Question 11:

**Which of the following is preserved in execution of transaction in isolation?**
*   a) Atomicity
*   b) Isolation
*   c) Durability
*   d) Consistency

**Answer:** d) Consistency (though the question is a bit circular if interpreted strictly)

Let me rephrase to avoid the circularity: "If transactions are executed in isolation, which ACID property implies that the database remains in a valid state?"

**Explanation:**

The question is asking what property is *upheld* or *ensured* if transactions manage to execute in isolation. This relates to the ACID properties of transactions:

*   **Atomicity:** Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. Either all of its operations are completed, or none of them are. If a transaction fails, any changes it made are rolled back.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid (consistent) state to another valid (consistent) state. It doesn't refer to data being identical (that's more related to isolation levels) but to the database adhering to all defined rules, constraints, triggers, etc.
*   **Isolation:** Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. The intermediate state of a transaction is not visible to other transactions. It's as if transactions are executed serially, one after another, even though they might be running concurrently.
*   **Durability:** Ensures that once a transaction has been committed, its changes are permanent and will survive any subsequent system failures (like power outages or crashes).

**The Question's Implication:**
The question "Which of the following is preserved in execution of transaction in isolation?" is a bit tautological if you pick 'Isolation'. The key is that **isolation** helps to ensure **consistency**.

If transactions are *not* isolated properly, one transaction might see the incomplete and inconsistent intermediate results of another, potentially leading to the database ending up in an inconsistent state. For example, if one transaction is in the middle of transferring funds (debit from A, credit to B) and another transaction reads the balances before the credit to B is complete, it sees an inconsistent state (money is gone from A but not yet in B).

By enforcing isolation, the system ensures that each transaction sees the database in a consistent state before it begins, and when it commits, it leaves the database in another consistent state. The programmer of the transaction is responsible for ensuring their transaction is logically correct (i.e., it would maintain consistency if run alone). Isolation then ensures that concurrent execution doesn't break this.

Therefore, while 'Isolation' is listed, the property that *benefits* from or is *preserved by* proper isolation is **Consistency**. A transaction, when executed in isolation, takes a consistent database state and leaves it in a consistent state.

*Self-correction:* The question is "Which of the following is preserved...". Isolation itself is the property that says transactions are protected from each other. Because of isolation, each transaction can assume it's the only one running, which simplifies the logic needed to maintain consistency. So, isolation is a mechanism to achieve consistency in a concurrent environment.

If a transaction is truly executed in isolation, it means its effects are as if no other transactions are running. This isolated execution, if the transaction logic itself is correct, will maintain the consistency of the database.

Given the options, and the common understanding of ACID, **Consistency** is the database property that is preserved *by* the correct implementation of isolated transactions.

Consider the common phrase: "Isolation ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially, thus preserving consistency."

### Question 12:

**Given the following relation instance.**
x y z
1 4 2
1 5 3
1 6 3
3 2 2

**Identify the statement among the following that is FALSE.**
*   a) XY → Z and Z → Y
*   b) YZ → X and Y → Z
*   c) YZ → X and X → Z
*   d) XZ → Y and Y → X

To solve this, we need to check each functional dependency (FD) against the given data.
A functional dependency A → B means that for any two tuples in the relation, if they have the same value for attribute(s) A, they must also have the same value for attribute(s) B.

Let's examine the data:
t1: (x=1, y=4, z=2)
t2: (x=1, y=5, z=3)
t3: (x=1, y=6, z=3)
t4: (x=3, y=2, z=2)

**a) XY → Z and Z → Y**
*   **XY → Z:**
    *   (1,4) → 2
    *   (1,5) → 3
    *   (1,6) → 3
    *   (3,2) → 2
    All XY pairs are unique, so they trivially determine Z. (TRUE)
*   **Z → Y:**
    *   Does z=2 always imply the same y?
        *   t1: z=2, y=4
        *   t4: z=2, y=2
        Here, z=2 maps to y=4 and y=2. So Z → Y is FALSE.
    Since one part (Z → Y) is false, statement (a) as a whole claim (that *both* hold) is only true if *both* FDs hold. But Z -> Y is false from our check. The question asks for the FALSE statement *among the options*. So, if option 'a' means "The FD XY → Z holds AND the FD Z → Y holds", and we found Z → Y is false, then the combined statement "XY → Z and Z → Y" (interpreted as *both* being true) is FALSE. This looks like our answer. Let's verify the others.

**Let's re-evaluate the meaning of the options.** An option like "A and B" as a statement is true if and only if both A and B are true. If either A or B is false, the statement "A and B" is false.

Let's check each individual FD's truthfulness first.

*   **XY → Z:**
    *   (1,4) uniquely maps to 2.
    *   (1,5) uniquely maps to 3.
    *   (1,6) uniquely maps to 3.
    *   (3,2) uniquely maps to 2.
    Since all (X,Y) pairs are distinct, XY → Z is TRUE.

*   **Z → Y:**
    *   For z=2: we have y=4 (in t1) and y=2 (in t4). Different y's for the same z.
    So, **Z → Y is FALSE.**

*   **YZ → X:**
    *   (4,2) → 1
    *   (5,3) → 1
    *   (6,3) → 1
    *   (2,2) → 3
    Are there repeated YZ values?
        *   (y=5, z=3) maps to x=1 (t2)
        *   (y=6, z=3) maps to x=1 (t3)
    These are different YZ pairs. All YZ pairs are unique, so YZ → X is TRUE.

*   **Y → Z:**
    *   For y=4: z=2 (t1)
    *   For y=5: z=3 (t2)
    *   For y=6: z=3 (t3)
    *   For y=2: z=2 (t4)
    All y values are distinct in this dataset, so Y → Z is TRUE for this instance.

*   **X → Z:**
    *   For x=1: we have z=2 (t1), z=3 (t2), z=3 (t3). Different z's for the same x.
    So, **X → Z is FALSE.**

*   **XZ → Y:**
    *   (1,2) → 4 (t1)
    *   (1,3) → 5 (t2)
    *   (1,3) → 6 (t3)
    Here, for XZ = (1,3), we have y=5 and y=6. Different y's for the same XZ.
    So, **XZ → Y is FALSE.**

*   **Y → X:**
    *   y=4 → x=1
    *   y=5 → x=1
    *   y=6 → x=1
    *   y=2 → x=3
    All y values are distinct, so Y → X is TRUE for this instance.

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **a) XY → Z (TRUE) and Z → Y (FALSE)**
    Statement "TRUE and FALSE" is **FALSE**.

*   **b) YZ → X (TRUE) and Y → Z (TRUE)**
    Statement "TRUE and TRUE" is **TRUE**.

*   **c) YZ → X (TRUE) and X → Z (FALSE)**
    Statement "TRUE and FALSE" is **FALSE**.

*   **d) XZ → Y (FALSE) and Y → X (TRUE)**
    Statement "FALSE and TRUE" is **FALSE**.

The question asks to "Identify the statement among the following that is FALSE."
We have found three statements (a, c, d) that are FALSE. This implies there might be an error in my FD derivations or in the question/options, as usually there's only one "most false" or one definitively false option in such MCQs.

Let's re-check the FDs meticulously.
Data:
t1: (x=1, y=4, z=2)
t2: (x=1, y=5, z=3)
t3: (x=1, y=6, z=3)
t4: (x=3, y=2, z=2)

FD Checks:
1.  **XY → Z**:
    (1,4) → 2
    (1,5) → 3
    (1,6) → 3
    (3,2) → 2
    No conflict. XY determines Z. **TRUE**.

2.  **Z → Y**:
    z=2: y=4 (t1), y=2 (t4). Conflict. Z does not determine Y. **FALSE**.

3.  **YZ → X**:
    (4,2) → 1
    (5,3) → 1
    (6,3) → 1
    (2,2) → 3
    No conflict. YZ determines X. **TRUE**.

4.  **Y → Z**:
    y=4 → z=2
    y=5 → z=3
    y=6 → z=3
    y=2 → z=2
    No occurrences of the same Y having different Z. **TRUE**.

5.  **X → Z**:
    x=1: z=2 (t1), z=3 (t2), z=3 (t3). Conflict (1→2 and 1→3). X does not determine Z. **FALSE**.

6.  **XZ → Y**:
    (1,2) → y=4 (t1)
    (1,3) → y=5 (t2)
    (1,3) → y=6 (t3)
    Conflict for XZ=(1,3). XZ does not determine Y. **FALSE**.

7.  **Y → X**:
    y=4 → x=1
    y=5 → x=1
    y=6 → x=1
    y=2 → x=3
    No occurrences of the same Y having different X. **TRUE**.

Now, re-evaluate the options:
*   **a) XY → Z (TRUE) and Z → Y (FALSE)**. The statement "TRUE and FALSE" is **FALSE**.
*   **b) YZ → X (TRUE) and Y → Z (TRUE)**. The statement "TRUE and TRUE" is **TRUE**.
*   **c) YZ → X (TRUE) and X → Z (FALSE)**. The statement "TRUE and FALSE" is **FALSE**.
*   **d) XZ → Y (FALSE) and Y → X (TRUE)**. The statement "FALSE and TRUE" is **FALSE**.

This is problematic. If the question asks for *the* statement that is FALSE, and there are three false statements, there's an issue.
Possibilities:
1.  An error in my understanding of how to evaluate the "statement".
2.  An error in my FD checking (double-checked, seems okay).
3.  The question implies something else, like some FDs are given and we have to find a property that is false among the combined set. (Unlikely wording for that).
4.  There's an error in the question or options provided in the exam. This happens.

Let's consider if the "and" might be interpreted differently.
Could it be that "Statement: FD1 and FD2" means we are checking if both FD1 and FD2 *must necessarily hold* based on some underlying schema, not just the instance? But the question says "Given the following relation instance." so it's instance-based.

What if Z → Y was typo and should be Z → X or something else?

Let's assume the question is valid and I need to find a unique false statement.
Perhaps the "statement" refers to the overall assertion, and only one option results in a FALSE overall assertion.

Is it possible that the question is specifically asking about non-trivial FDs? All these look potentially non-trivial.

If the question means "Which of these lines contains at least one false functional dependency assertion?", then (a), (c), and (d) all contain at least one false FD.

If an option like "FD1 and FD2" is a statement, then the statement is false if *at least one* FD is false or if *both* are false. The statement is true *only if both* FDs are true.

So, the task is to find which of the *compound statements* (a, b, c, d) is FALSE.
*   a) XY → Z (T) **and** Z → Y (F)  =>  T and F  => **FALSE**
*   b) YZ → X (T) **and** Y → Z (T)  =>  T and T  => **TRUE**
*   c) YZ → X (T) **and** X → Z (F)  =>  T and F  => **FALSE**
*   d) XZ → Y (F) **and** Y → X (T)  =>  F and T  => **FALSE**

Still, options a, c, and d are FALSE. This means there could be an error in the question.
However, in a multiple-choice test, if there are multiple technically correct answers for "which is false", there might be one that is "more directly" or "more obviously" false, or perhaps I misinterpreted something subtle.

Let's look at them again.
a) Z → Y is clearly violated: (t1: z=2, y=4) vs (t4: z=2, y=2).
c) X → Z is clearly violated: (t1: x=1, z=2) vs (t2: x=1, z=3).
d) XZ → Y is clearly violated: (t2: x=1,z=3 → y=5) vs (t3: x=1,z=3 → y=6).

All these violations are direct and simple.

Could there be a typo in my transcription of the data or the options?
x y z
1 4 2 (t1)
1 5 3 (t2)
1 6 3 (t3)
3 2 2 (t4)

a) XY → Z and Z → Y
b) YZ → X and Y → Z
c) YZ → X and X → Z
d) XZ → Y and Y → X

The analysis seems correct so far, leading to three false options.
In an exam setting, if faced with this, I would re-check my work. If confident, I'd suspect an error in the question.

If the question were "Identify the statement among the following that is TRUE", then (b) would be the clear answer.
Since it asks for FALSE, and a, c, d are all false:

Let's assume there is a single answer. What could make one FD "more false" or one compound statement uniquely false?
This does not seem to be the case here; the logic for "A and B" being false is straightforward.

Could it be about minimal FDs or something? No indication.

Let's pick one that seems direct. For (a), Z → Y is false due to (1,4,2) and (3,2,2). The XY→Z part is true.
For (c), X → Z is false due to (1,4,2) and (1,5,3). The YZ→X part is true.
For (d), XZ → Y is false due to (1,5,3) and (1,6,3). The Y→X part is true.

There 's no distinguishing feature.
Perhaps the question expected us to check the *first* part of the "and" statement, and if false, mark the whole thing false, or check the second part. This seems unlikely.

Let me search if there's any subtlety in evaluating combined FDs like this. Usually, "A and B" means both must hold for the statement to be true.
It's a standard logic.

Perhaps the question intends to ask "Which functional dependency listed in the options is false?" but is poorly worded.
If Z → Y is false, then statement (a) is false.
If X → Z is false, then statement (c) is false.
If XZ → Y is false, then statement (d) is false.

Let's assume, for the sake of getting *an* answer for a typical exam scenario, that there's no error in my method and there might indeed be an error in the question where multiple options are false. If forced to pick only one, there's no logical basis to prefer one over the others from a, c, d.

However, if this were a "select all that apply" that were false, a, c, and d would be it. Since it's MCQ implyng a single answer, this is problematic.

Let's go back to the basics. Statement (b) is TRUE. So, if the question is correct and has ONE false statement, then my analysis of (b) being true must be correct.
YZ -> X (TRUE), Y -> Z (TRUE). So (b) is TRUE.

If the question "Identify the statement among the following that is FALSE" is well-posed, and only one answer is expected to be false, then my analysis that a, c, and d are ALL false must have an error. Let me re-check the TRUE ones.

XY → Z:
(1,4)→2
(1,5)→3
(1,6)→3
(3,2)→2
This is TRUE.

Z → Y:
z=2: y=4 (t1), y=2 (t4). **FALSE.**

YZ → X:
(4,2)→1
(5,3)→1
(6,3)→1
(2,2)→3
This is TRUE.

Y → Z:
y=4→z=2
y=5→z=3
y=6→z=3
y=2→z=2
This is TRUE.

X → Z:
x=1: z=2 (t1), z=3 (t2). **FALSE.**

XZ → Y:
(1,2)→y=4
(1,3)→y=5 (t2), y=6 (t3). **FALSE.**

Y → X:
y=4→x=1
y=5→x=1
y=6→x=1
y=2→x=3
This is TRUE.

Re-evaluating options:
a) XY → Z (T) and Z → Y (F). Result: **FALSE**.
b) YZ → X (T) and Y → Z (T). Result: **TRUE**.
c) YZ → X (T) and X → Z (F). Result: **FALSE**.
d) XZ → Y (F) and Y → X (T). Result: **FALSE**.

My analysis consistently shows (b) is TRUE, and (a), (c), (d) are FALSE.
Given that this is an exam question, there must be a single FALSE statement if it's phrased as "Identify the statement...that is FALSE".
This leads to a strong suspicion of an error in the question itself or the provided options, or I am missing a very specific convention.

If the question instead was "Identify the statement among the following that is TRUE", then **(b)** would be the answer.
Given the question asks for the FALSE statement, and I identify three, let's select one of them. There's no further criterion provided. I'll pick (a) as the first one I determined to be false. But this is arbitrary.

Assuming this is a typical exam question style where there is one correct answer, and my analysis shows three options are false and one is true (option b), then the question "Identify the statement... that is FALSE" is problematic. If the question *actually* meant to ask "Identify the statement... that is TRUE", then (b) is the answer.

If we absolutely must pick a FALSE one according to the question as written, any of (a), (c), or (d) would be valid. I'll stick with (a) because Z→Y being false is a very clear violation.

Final decision for Q12: Assuming the question is "Identify the statement among the following that is FALSE", then (a), (c), and (d) are all false. If there's a single intended answer, the question is flawed. If I must pick one of the false ones, I'll pick (a).

This kind of ambiguity is frustrating in exams. What if one of the TRUE FDs I found is actually false on closer inspection allowing one of b,c or d to become TRUE?
Let's re-check the "TRUE" FDs:
XY → Z: Distinct (X,Y) pairs ensure this is true for this instance.
YZ → X: Distinct (Y,Z) pairs ensure this is true for this instance.
Y → Z: Distinct Y values ensure this is true for this instance.
Y → X: Distinct Y values ensure this is true for this instance.

My assessment of individual FDs for the given instance seems robust. The issue is that three options evaluate to FALSE. This often happens in poorly set questions. If the solution key says, for example, (c) is the answer, it doesn't invalidate that (a) and (d) are also false.

Given the structure of such questions, they usually look for a unique answer. The only unique evaluation here is that statement (b) is TRUE. Perhaps the question is a typo and should be "Identify the statement... that is TRUE"? If so, (b) is the choice. If it is indeed "FALSE", then the question is flawed. For now, I will provide answers based on the question as written and note the ambiguity.

Answer for Q12 based on evaluation: Any of (a), (c), or (d). I will select (a) for bookkeeping.

### Question 13:

**Identify the statement among the following that is FALSE.**
*   a) The relation in which all keys have only a single attribute is in its 2NF
*   b) A relation that has two attributes is in its BCNF
*   c) The prime attribute can depend transitively on any key in the case of a relation that is in its BCNF
*   d) The prime attribute can depend transitively on any key in the case of a relation that is in its 3NF

**Explanation of Normal Forms:**

*   **1NF (First Normal Form):** All attributes contain atomic values (no multi-valued attributes or composite attributes within a cell). All relations are assumed to be in 1NF by definition in a relational database.
*   **2NF (Second Normal Form):**
    1.  It is in 1NF.
    2.  There are no partial dependencies. A partial dependency exists if a non-prime attribute (an attribute not part of any candidate key) is functionally dependent on only a part of a composite candidate key. If all candidate keys are simple (single attribute), then there can be no partial dependencies, so the relation is automatically in 2NF.
*   **3NF (Third Normal Form):**
    1.  It is in 2NF.
    2.  There are no transitive dependencies of non-prime attributes on any candidate key. A transitive dependency exists if A → B and B → C, where A is a candidate key (or part of it), and C is a non-prime attribute, and B is not a candidate key. More formally for a relation R to be in 3NF, for every non-trivial FD X → A, either:
        *   X is a superkey, OR
        *   A is a prime attribute (part of some candidate key).
*   **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):**
    1.  It is in 3NF (implicitly, though the definition is stricter).
    2.  For every non-trivial functional dependency X → A, X must be a superkey. This is a stricter condition than 3NF. BCNF eliminates all anamolies related to functional dependencies.

Let's evaluate the statements:

*   **a) The relation in which all keys have only a single attribute is in its 2NF.**
    If all candidate keys are single attributes, then no non-prime attribute can be dependent on *part* of a key (because the keys have no smaller parts). Thus, there can be no partial dependencies. If it's in 1NF and has no partial dependencies, it's in 2NF. This statement appears **TRUE**.

*   **b) A relation that has two attributes is in its BCNF.**
    Consider a relation R(A, B).
    Possible FDs (non-trivial):
    1.  A → B: Then A is the key. For A → B, the determinant A is a superkey. So, BCNF holds.
    2.  B → A: Then B is the key. For B → A, the determinant B is a superkey. So, BCNF holds.
    3.  A → B and B → A: Then both A and B are keys. For A → B, A is a key (superkey). For B → A, B is a key (superkey). So, BCNF holds.
    4.  No non-trivial FDs: Any FD X → Y has X as a superkey (since the only superkeys are {A,B} for the trivial FD {A,B} → {A,B} or individual attributes if they determine the other). This means it has no dependencies to violate BCNF.
    Essentially, if you have R(A,B), any non-trivial FD must have a superkey as its determinant. For example, if A → B is the only FD, A is the key. If there are no FDs, it's trivially in BCNF.  This statement appears **TRUE**.

*   **c) The prime attribute can depend transitively on any key in the case of a relation that is in its BCNF.**
    BCNF definition: For every X → Y, X must be a superkey.
    A transitive dependency looks like: Key → NonKeyAtt → PrimeAtt (or Key → Att1 → Att2 where Att2 is prime).
    If we have Key → A and A → P (where P is a prime attribute and A is not a superkey), then for the FD A → P to satisfy BCNF, A must be a superkey.
    If A is a superkey, then it's not really a "transitive dependency" in the problematic sense that 3NF tries to remove for non-prime attributes.
    The BCNF condition (X → Y implies X is a superkey) is very strict. It does not allow any non-trivial FD where the determinant is not a superkey.
    Transitive dependency implies a chain of dependencies like K -> A -> P where P is prime, A is not a superkey, and K is a key.
    If A -> P holds and the relation is in BCNF, then A must be a superkey.
    If A is a superkey, then the dependency K -> A is not the only way to determine A; A itself can be a key.
    The statement implies that a prime attribute *can* depend transitively.
    BCNF is designed to eliminate redundancy. If a prime attribute P is transitively dependent on a key K via A (K → A, A → P), and the relation is in BCNF, then for A → P, A must be a superkey.
    This means there's no "problematic" transitive dependency leading to a prime attribute that BCNF wouldn't have already addressed by making A a superkey.
    BCNF has no transitive dependencies where the intermediate attribute is not a superkey.
    Therefore, if P is transitively dependent on key K (via some X: K -> X -> P), and the relation is in BCNF, then for X -> P to hold, X must be a superkey. This effectively breaks the "transitive" nature in a problematic way.
    This statement says a prime attribute CAN depend transitively on a key. BCNF works to remove such issues if the intermediate isn't a superkey.
    If X is a superkey, then X -> P is a direct dependency from a superkey, which is fine.
    So, if Key -> X and X -> Prime_Attribute, then in BCNF, X must be a superkey. This doesn't fit the classic problematic transitive dependency.
    This statement is likely **FALSE** because BCNF is stricter and aims to remove such dependencies when the intermediate attribute is not a superkey.

*   **d) The prime attribute can depend transitively on any key in the case of a relation that is in its 3NF.**
    3NF allows a prime attribute to depend transitively on a key.
    The definition of 3NF is: For every X → A, either X is a superkey OR A is a prime attribute.
    Consider Key → B, and B → PrimeAttr. Here A is PrimeAttr.
    In the transitive dependency K → B → P (where P is a prime attribute), for the relation to be in 3NF:
    1.  For K → B: K is a superkey. (Satisfied)
    2.  For B → P: Either B is a superkey (then it's BCNF for this FD) OR P is a prime attribute.
    The condition "P is a prime attribute" *allows* the FD B → P even if B is not a superkey. This is precisely the kind of transitive dependency (where a prime attribute depends on another non-key or even key attribute, which in turn depends on the primary key) that 3NF permits but BCNF might not (if B is not a superkey).
    So, yes, in 3NF, a prime attribute *can* depend transitively on a key. This statement appears **TRUE**.

Based on this, statement (c) seems to be the FALSE one. BCNF is more restrictive.
Let's search to confirm the subtleties with prime attributes in BCNF and 3NF.
The search results confirm:
*   (a) True: If all keys are single attributes, no partial dependencies on parts of keys can exist, satisfying a 2NF condition.
*   (b) True: "Any relation with two attributes is always in BCNF." For any FD X->A, X must be a superkey. With two attributes, if A->B, A is a key.
*   (d) True: 3NF allows for X->Y where Y is a prime attribute even if X is not a superkey. This can lead to a situation like Key -> NonKey, NonKey -> PrimeAttribute, which is a transitive dependency of a prime attribute on a key, and it's acceptable in 3NF.
*   (c) False: BCNF is stricter. For every FD X->Y, X must be a superkey. If there's Key -> A -> PrimeAttr, then for A -> PrimeAttr to hold in BCNF, A must be a superkey. This means a prime attribute cannot be transitively dependent on a key via a *non-superkey* attribute in BCNF.

So the statement that is false is (c).

**Answer for Q13: c) The prime attribute can depend transitively on any key in the case of a relation that is in its BCNF**

### Question 14:

**SQL allows tuples in relations, and correspondingly defines the multiplicity of tuples in the result of joins. Which one of the following queries always gives the same answer as the nested query shown below:**
`select * from R where a in (select S.a from S)`

*   a) `select R.* from R, S where R.a=S.a (D)` (The (D) might indicate DISTINCT or be a typo)
*   b) `select distinct R.* from R,S where R.a=S.a`
*   c) `select R.* from R, (select distinct a from S) as S1 where R.a=S1.a`
*   d) `select R.* from R,S where R.a=S.a and is unique R` (This "is unique R" is not standard SQL syntax)

**Explanation:**

The original nested query: `select * from R where a in (select S.a from S)`
This query selects all rows from R where the value of attribute 'a' in R is present in the set of all 'a' values from table S. The subquery `(select S.a from S)` might produce duplicate values of 'a' from S, but the `IN` operator effectively treats this as a set of unique values. For example, if S.a contains (1, 2, 2, 3), then `R.a IN (1, 2, 3)`.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **a) `select R.* from R, S where R.a=S.a`**
    This is an inner join. If a value `R.a` matches multiple `S.a` values (e.g., R has (x=1, a=10) and S has (a=10, b=p), (a=10, b=q)), then the tuple from R will be duplicated in the result. The original query would only return the R tuple once. So, this is not equivalent if S.a has duplicates or if one R.a value matches multiple (even distinct) S.a values that are the same. The `(D)` is ambiguous without further context, but if it meant something like "assuming S.a is distinct", then it gets closer.

*   **b) `select distinct R.* from R,S where R.a=S.a`**
    This performs an inner join and then selects distinct rows from R that participated in the join. If a row in R matches multiple rows in S (even if those S rows are different otherwise but have the same S.a that matches R.a), the R row would be outputted once due to `DISTINCT R.*`. This is very close. If R.a = v1 and S contains multiple rows with S.a = v1, the original query returns the R tuple once. This query would also return the R tuple once. This looks like a strong candidate.

*   **c) `select R.* from R, (select distinct a from S) as S1 where R.a=S1.a`**
    Here, the subquery `(select distinct a from S) as S1` creates a temporary table S1 containing only unique values of 'a' from S. Then, R is joined with S1 on `R.a = S1.a`.
    If `R.a` matches an `S1.a`, the tuple from R is selected. Since `S1.a` values are distinct, an `R.a` value can match at most one row in S1. Therefore, each matching row from R will appear exactly once, without duplication caused by S. This seems equivalent to the original query's behavior.

*   **d) `select R.* from R,S where R.a=S.a and is unique R`**
    "is unique R" is not standard SQL. If it implies that all tuples in R are unique by themselves (which is inherent in a relation if we consider primary keys, but R.* includes all attributes), or that R.a is unique in R, it still has the duplication problem from S like in (a) if not handled. This option is syntactically incorrect.

**Comparing (b) and (c):**
Original: `select * from R where a in (select S.a from S)`
*   For each row in R, it checks if `R.a` is present in the set of values `{s.a | s ∈ S}`.

(b) `select distinct R.* from R,S where R.a=S.a`
*   This joins R and S. If `R1` from R (with `R1.a=v`) joins with `S1` from S (with `S1.a=v`) and `S2` from S (with `S2.a=v`), the intermediate result before distinct would have `R1` twice. `distinct R.*` would then select `R1` once. This seems correct.

(c) `select R.* from R, (select distinct a from S) as S1 where R.a=S1.a`
*   This joins R with a version of S that only has distinct 'a' values. If `R1` from R (with `R1.a=v`) joins with `S1_distinct_a` (which has `a=v` appearing once), `R1` appears once. This also seems correct and is often a more efficient way to write the `IN` subquery.

Many database systems would optimize an `IN` subquery like the original to something very similar to an `EXISTS` clause or a semi-join, which has the semantics of (c). SQL `IN` with a subquery does not produce duplicate rows from the outer query if the outer query's row matches multiple rows in the subquery result.

Let's test with an example:
R: (id, a) -> (r1, 10), (r2, 20), (r3, 10)
S: (key, a, b) -> (s1, 10, p), (s2, 10, q), (s3, 30, r), (s4, 10, p)

Original Query: `select * from R where a in (select S.a from S)`
`select S.a from S` gives (10, 10, 30, 10). The distinct values are (10, 30).
R where R.a in (10, 30):
(r1, 10) -> Yes
(r2, 20) -> No
(r3, 10) -> Yes
Result: (r1, 10), (r3, 10)

(b) `select distinct R.* from R,S where R.a=S.a`
Join R,S on R.a=S.a:
(r1,10) with (s1,10,p) -> (r1,10)
(r1,10) with (s2,10,q) -> (r1,10)
(r1,10) with (s4,10,p) -> (r1,10)
(r3,10) with (s1,10,p) -> (r3,10)
(r3,10) with (s2,10,q) -> (r3,10)
(r3,10) with (s4,10,p) -> (r3,10)
Distinct R.* from this: (r1,10), (r3,10).
This matches.

(c) `select R.* from R, (select distinct a from S) as S1 where R.a=S1.a`
S1: (select distinct a from S) -> (a=10), (a=30)
Join R with S1 on R.a=S1.a:
(r1,10) with (a=10) from S1 -> (r1,10)
(r3,10) with (a=10) from S1 -> (r3,10)
Result: (r1,10), (r3,10).
This also matches.

So both (b) and (c) seem to produce the same result as the original.
Often, `EXISTS` or a semi-join (which (c) effectively implements) is the canonical way to rewrite `IN`.
Let me check if there's a subtle difference between (b) and (c) or a reason to prefer one.
(c) is generally considered a good way to rewrite `IN (subquery)`.
`SELECT DISTINCT T1.* FROM T1 JOIN T2 ON T1.key = T2.key` is typically equivalent to `SELECT T1.* FROM T1 WHERE T1.key IN (SELECT T2.key FROM T2)` if T1's key is unique or all columns are selected.
And `SELECT T1.* FROM T1 JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT key FROM T2) AS T2_DISTINCT ON T1.key = T2_DISTINCT.key` is also equivalent.

Query (b) and query (c) should be equivalent to the original query given SQL standards.
In many cases, `IN` is translated to a form closer to (c) by query optimizers (a semi-join).
The join in (b) `R,S where R.a=S.a` could create a very large intermediate set if S has many duplicates for matching 'a' values, *before* the `DISTINCT R.*` is applied. Query (c) first reduces S to `S1` with distinct `a` values, then joins. This can be more efficient.

The phrase "always gives the same answer" is key.
Both (b) and (c) have strong claims. However, `EXISTS` is often the preferred rewrite. The structure of (c) is very similar to a semi-join strategy typical for `IN`.

If `R.a` can be NULL, and `S.a` can be NULL:
`IN` semantics with NULLs are tricky. `val IN (1, 2, NULL)` has specific behavior.
`R.a = S1.a` will not match if `R.a` is NULL.
`R.a IN (SELECT S.a FROM S)`: If `R.a` is NULL, the result of the `IN` predicate is UNKNOWN, so the row is not selected. If `S.a` contains NULLs, they are generally ignored by `IN` unless `R.a` itself is NULL.

Let's focus on the core logic without NULLs initially, as standard examples do.
Both (b) and (c) appear equivalent. Is there a specific reason one would be *always* the same and the other not quite, or one considered more directly equivalent?

The use of `R.*` with `DISTINCT` in (b) `select distinct R.*` means if R itself contains duplicate rows (e.g. `(r1, 10)` appears twice in R), and `R.a=10` matches in S, the original query would output both identical `(r1, 10)` rows from R. Option (b) however, `select distinct R.*`, would only output `(r1, 10)` once in such a scenario. This is a key difference. The original `select * from R` does not imply distinctness of R rows *before* the `where` clause.

Let's re-evaluate with R having duplicates:
R: (id, a) -> (r1, 10), (r2, 20), (r1, 10)  <- R has duplicate rows
S: (key, a, b) -> (s1, 10, p)

Original Query: `select * from R where a in (select S.a from S)`
`select S.a from S` gives (10).
R where R.a in (10):
First (r1, 10) -> Yes
(r2, 20) -> No
Second (r1, 10) -> Yes
Result: (r1, 10), (r1, 10) <- two identical rows because they came from R

(b) `select distinct R.* from R,S where R.a=S.a`
Join:
Both rows (r1,10) from R will join with (s1,10,p) from S.
Intermediate: (r1,10) from first R row, (r1,10) from second R row.
`distinct R.*` on this will yield: (r1,10) <- only once.
**So (b) is NOT equivalent if R can have duplicate rows.**

(c) `select R.* from R, (select distinct a from S) as S1 where R.a=S1.a`
S1: (a=10)
Join R with S1:
First R row (r1,10) with S1(a=10) -> produces (r1,10)
Second R row (r1,10) with S1(a=10) -> produces (r1,10)
(r2,20) does not join.
Result: (r1,10), (r1,10) <- two identical rows.
**This matches the original query's behavior even if R has duplicate rows.**

This distinction is crucial. The `IN` clause acts as a filter on rows from R, it doesn't inherently make the selected rows from R distinct if they weren't distinct to begin with.

Therefore, (c) is the correct equivalent.

**Answer for Q14: c) `select R.* from R, (select distinct a from S) as S1 where R.a=S1.a`**

### Question 15:

**The term for information that describes what type of data is available in a database is:**
*   a) Data dictionary
*   b) Data repository
*   c) Index data
*   d) Metadata

**Answer:** d) Metadata

**Explanation:**

*   **Metadata:** This is "data about data." It describes the structure, content, quality, condition, and other characteristics of data. In the context of a database, metadata includes:
    *   Schema information: names of tables, columns, data types of columns, constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints), relationships between tables.
    *   Information about indexes, views, stored procedures, triggers.
    *   Storage information, access permissions, usage statistics, etc.
    Metadata is essential for the DBMS to manage and interpret the actual data.
*   **Data Dictionary:** A data dictionary is a specific type of metadata repository. It's a centralized collection of information about data, such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format. So, while a data dictionary *contains* metadata, "metadata" is the broader and more general term for the descriptive information itself. Many consider the data dictionary to be a core component of metadata management.
*   **Data Repository:** This is a general term for a place where data is stored. It could be a database, a data warehouse, a data lake, etc. While it *contains* data and its associated metadata, "data repository" itself isn't the term for the descriptive information.
*   **Index Data:** This refers to the data structures (like B-trees) that are created to speed up data retrieval operations on specific columns in a table. While indexes are part of the database structure and described by metadata, "index data" is not the term for the overall description of data types available.

Given the options, **Metadata** is the most accurate and encompassing term for information that describes what type of data is available in a database. A data dictionary is a *form* of or *part of* metadata.

### Question 16:

**Consider the relation Cinema(theater, address, capacity)**
**Which of the following options will be needed at the end of the SQL query**
`SELECT P1.address FROM Cinema P1`
**such that it always finds the addresses of theaters with maximum capacity?**

*   a) `WHERE P1.capacity >= All (select P2.capacity from Cinema P2)`
*   b) `WHERE P1.capacity >= Any (select P2.capacity from Cinema P2)`
*   c) `WHERE P1.capacity > All (select max(P2.capacity) from Cinema P2)`
*   d) `WHERE P1.capacity > Any (select max(P2.capacity) from Cinema P2)`

**Explanation:**

We want to find addresses of theaters that have the overall maximum capacity found in the entire `Cinema` table. Let `max_cap` be this maximum capacity. We need `P1.capacity = max_cap`.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **a) `WHERE P1.capacity >= All (select P2.capacity from Cinema P2)`**
    The subquery `(select P2.capacity from Cinema P2)` returns all capacity values from the Cinema table.
    The condition `P1.capacity >= All (list_of_all_capacities)` means that `P1.capacity` must be greater than or equal to *every single capacity value* in the table. This is equivalent to saying `P1.capacity` is the maximum capacity. If there are multiple theaters with this same maximum capacity, all of them will be selected. This looks correct.

*   **b) `WHERE P1.capacity >= Any (select P2.capacity from Cinema P2)`**
    `>= Any` means `P1.capacity` must be greater than or equal to *at least one* capacity value in the table. This is true for almost all theaters (unless a theater had a capacity less than the minimum capacity, which is not the goal). For example, if capacities are (100, 200, 300), a theater with capacity 100 is `>= Any` (e.g., >= 100). This will not select only those with maximum capacity. This is incorrect.

*   **c) `WHERE P1.capacity > All (select max(P2.capacity) from Cinema P2)`**
    The subquery `(select max(P2.capacity) from Cinema P2)` returns a single value: the maximum capacity in the table. Let this be `max_val`.
    The condition becomes `P1.capacity > max_val`. This means `P1.capacity` must be strictly greater than the maximum capacity. This is impossible, so it would return no rows (unless there's an issue with NULLs, but assuming capacities are not NULL and are positive). This is incorrect for finding theaters *with* maximum capacity.

*   **d) `WHERE P1.capacity > Any (select max(P2.capacity) from Cinema P2)`**
    The subquery `(select max(P2.capacity) from Cinema P2)` returns a single value: `max_val`.
    The condition becomes `P1.capacity > Any (max_val)`. Since `Any` with a single value list is just that value, this is `P1.capacity > max_val`. This is the same as (c) and is incorrect.

**Therefore, option (a) correctly finds the theaters with maximum capacity.**
Another common way to write this would be:
`WHERE P1.capacity = (select MAX(P2.capacity) from Cinema P2)`
Option (a) `P1.capacity >= All (select P2.capacity from Cinema P2)` is semantically equivalent to finding the maximum.

**Answer for Q16: a) `WHERE P1.capacity >= All (select P2.capacity from Cinema P2)`**

Okay, let's proceed to Page 3.

### Question 17:

**Consider the following two statements about database transaction schedules:**
**I. Strict two-phase locking protocol generates conflict serializable schedules that are also recoverable.**
**II. Timestamp-ordering concurrency control protocol with Thomas Write Rule can generate view serializable schedules that are not conflict serializable.**

**Which of the above statements is/are TRUE?**
*   a) Both I and II
*   b) I only
*   c) II only
*   d) Neither I nor II

**Answer:** a) Both I and II

**Explanation:**

*   **Statement I: Strict two-phase locking protocol generates conflict serializable schedules that are also recoverable.**
    *   **Two-Phase Locking (2PL):** A concurrency control protocol that ensures conflict serializability. It has two phases for each transaction:
        1.  **Growing Phase:** The transaction can acquire locks but cannot release any locks.
        2.  **Shrinking Phase:** The transaction can release locks but cannot acquire any new locks.
    *   **Strict 2PL:** This is a more restrictive version of 2PL where a transaction does not release any of its *exclusive (write)* locks until after it commits or aborts. It releases all locks at commit/abort time.
    *   **Conflict Serializable:** Schedules produced by 2PL are conflict serializable. Strict 2PL also produces conflict serializable schedules.
    *   **Recoverable Schedules:** A schedule is recoverable if, for any pair of transactions Ti and Tj, if Tj reads a data item previously written by Ti, then the commit operation of Ti must appear before the commit operation of Tj. Strict 2PL ensures recoverability because if Tj reads from Ti, Ti must have held a write lock. Tj can only acquire its read lock (or write lock on that item later) usually after Ti releases it (which, in Strict 2PL, happens at commit/abort). More importantly, Strict 2PL prevents *dirty reads* (reading uncommitted data) and ensures that if Tj reads data written by Ti, Ti must have committed before Tj reads it if Ti commits. If Ti aborts, Tj would also need to abort if it read Ti's data (this leads to cascading aborts, which Strict 2PL avoids). Strict 2PL ensures that any data read is committed data (if the writer commits), thereby preventing cascading aborts and ensuring recoverability (and even stricter forms like cascadelessness and strictness).
    *   In fact, Strict 2PL ensures **strict schedules** (a transaction can neither read nor write an item X until the last transaction that wrote X has committed or aborted). Strict schedules are cascadeless, and cascadeless schedules are recoverable.
    *   So, Statement I is **TRUE**.

*   **Statement II: Timestamp-ordering concurrency control protocol with Thomas Write Rule can generate view serializable schedules that are not conflict serializable.**
    *   **Timestamp Ordering (TO):** A concurrency control protocol where each transaction is assigned a unique timestamp. Conflicting operations are ordered based on these timestamps.
    *   **Thomas Write Rule:** This is a modification to the basic TO protocol. If a transaction Ti issues a write operation on data item X, but the timestamp of Ti is older than the timestamp of the last transaction that *wrote* X (TS(Ti) < WTS(X)), then Ti's write is too late and would have overwritten a newer value. Instead of aborting Ti, the Thomas Write Rule allows Ti's write to be ignored (skipped). This is because a later transaction (with a larger timestamp) has already written the value, and any transaction that would have read Ti's value would have already read the newer value (or its read would have been rejected if its timestamp was older than the newer write).
    *   **View Serializable:** A schedule is view serializable if it is view equivalent to some serial schedule.
    *   **Conflict Serializable:** A schedule is conflict serializable if it can be transformed into a serial schedule by a series of non-conflicting swaps of adjacent operations.
    *   The Thomas Write Rule can lead to schedules that are view serializable but not conflict serializable. The ignored write breaks the conflict pattern that would have been present in a conflict serializable schedule but still maintains view equivalence to a serial schedule where the ignored write effectively "never happened" or was immediately overwritten.
    *   So, Statement II is **TRUE**.

Since both statements I and II are true, the answer is (a).

### Question 18:

**B⁺ Trees are considered BALANCED because**
*   a) The lengths of the paths from the root to all leaf nodes are all equal.
*   b) The lengths of the paths from the root to all leaf nodes differ from each other by at most 1.
*   c) The number of children of any two non-leaf sibling nodes differ by at most 1.
*   D) The number of records in any two leaf nodes differ by at most 1.

**Answer:** a) The lengths of the paths from the root to all leaf nodes are all equal.

**Explanation:**

*   **B⁺ Tree:** A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. It's commonly used in databases and file systems for indexing.
*   **Balanced Tree:** In the context of B-trees and B⁺-trees, "balanced" has a very specific meaning:
    *   All leaf nodes are at the same level (depth). This means the distance (number of edges or nodes) from the root to any leaf node is identical.
*   **Properties of B⁺ Trees leading to balance:**
    *   All leaf nodes are at the same depth.
    *   Internal nodes (non-leaf nodes) must have a certain minimum number of children (related to the order of the tree), except possibly the root.
    *   The root has at least two children unless it is a leaf node (tree has very few elements).
    *   All nodes (except possibly the root) are at least half-full (or some other fraction depending on the specific B-tree variant rules).
*   **Evaluating the options:**
    *   **a) The lengths of the paths from the root to all leaf nodes are all equal.** This is the defining characteristic of balance in a B⁺ tree. **TRUE**.
    *   **b) The lengths of the paths from the root to all leaf nodes differ from each other by at most 1.** This is a property of AVL trees or Red-Black trees (height balance), not B⁺ trees. B⁺ trees are perfectly balanced in terms of leaf depth. **FALSE**.
    *   **c) The number of children of any two non-leaf sibling nodes differ by at most 1.** While B⁺ trees have rules about the minimum and maximum number of children for internal nodes, this specific statement about sibling nodes differing by at most 1 is not the reason they are called balanced, nor is it strictly always true in that exact phrasing for *any* two siblings. The fill factor rules apply individually to nodes. **FALSE**.
    *   **D) The number of records in any two leaf nodes differ by at most 1.** Leaf nodes in a B⁺ tree also have a minimum and maximum capacity for records/keys. While they aim for good utilization, there's no strict rule that any two leaf nodes must differ by at most 1 record. They must be at least half-full (typically). **FALSE**.

Therefore, the primary reason B⁺ trees are considered balanced is that all leaf nodes are at the same depth.

### Question 19:

**Which of the following relational query languages have the same expressive power?**
**I) Relational algebra**
**II) Tuple relational calculus restricted to safe expressions**
**III) Domain relational calculus restricted to safe expressions.**

*   a) II and III only
*   b) I and II only
*   c) I and III only
*   d) I, II and III

**Answer:** d) I, II and III

**Explanation:**

*   **Relational Algebra:** A procedural query language where queries are expressed by applying a sequence of operations (like SELECT, PROJECT, JOIN, UNION, DIFFERENCE, INTERSECTION, RENAME) to relations.
*   **Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC):** A non-procedural (declarative) query language where queries describe *what* data to retrieve without specifying *how* to retrieve it. Queries are expressed using tuples as variables, e.g., `{ t | P(t) }` where `t` is a tuple variable and `P(t)` is a formula describing the properties of the tuples to be retrieved.
*   **Domain Relational Calculus (DRC):** Another non-procedural query language, similar to TRC, but it uses domain variables (variables that range over the domains of attributes) instead of tuple variables, e.g., `{ <x, y, z> | P(x, y, z) }`.
*   **Safe Expressions:** Both TRC and DRC, if unrestricted, can express queries that result in infinite relations or results that are not well-defined within the scope of the database. "Safe expressions" are restrictions placed on calculus queries to ensure that they always produce finite results and only depend on the values present in the database. Common restrictions include ensuring that variables are appropriately bound to domains or existing relations.
*   **Expressive Power:** Codd's Theorem (or Codd's Rule) states that **Relational Algebra, (safe) Tuple Relational Calculus, and (safe) Domain Relational Calculus are equivalent in expressive power.** This means any query that can be expressed in one can be expressed in the others. This defines what is meant by a "relationally complete" query language.

Therefore, all three (Relational Algebra, safe TRC, and safe DRC) have the same expressive power.

### Question 20:

**An entity in A is associated with at most one entity in B. An entity in B, however, can be associated with any number (zero or more) of entities in A. This is**
*   a) One-to-many
*   b) One-to-one
*   c) Many-to-many
*   d) Many-to-one

**Answer:** d) Many-to-one (from A to B) or a) One-to-many (from B to A)

**Explanation of Cardinality:**

Cardinality in entity-relationship modeling describes the numerical relationship between occurrences of entities in one entity set and occurrences of entities in another entity set through a relationship.

Let's break down the given statements:
1.  **"An entity in A is associated with at most one entity in B."**
    This means if you pick one entity from set A, it can be related to zero or one entity in set B. From A's perspective looking towards B, it's a "to-one" relationship.
    A (1) ----- (0..1) B

2.  **"An entity in B, however, can be associated with any number (zero or more) of entities in A."**
    This means if you pick one entity from set B, it can be related to zero, one, or many entities in set A. From B's perspective looking towards A, it's a "to-many" relationship.
    A (0..*) ----- (1) B

**Combining these:**
*   One A is related to at most one B.
*   One B can be related to many As.

This describes a **Many-to-One** relationship from A to B (many A's can be related to one B).
Viewed from B to A, it's a **One-to-Many** relationship (one B can be related to many A's).

Let's see how the options fit (usually the direction is from the first mentioned entity to the second, or it's specified):

*   **a) One-to-many:** This would mean one A is related to many Bs, and one B is related to one A. This contradicts the first statement. However, if it implies a relationship R between A and B, and the question is asking for the type FROM B TO A, then "one B to many A's" fits.
*   **b) One-to-one:** One A to one B, and one B to one A. This contradicts the second statement.
*   **c) Many-to-many:** Many A's to many B's. This contradicts both statements when "at most one" is considered.
*   **d) Many-to-one:** Many A's to one B. This aligns with the description: An A maps to at most one B. Multiple A's can map to the same B. An entity in B can be associated with many A's.

If we consider the relationship from A to B:
A (many side for association with B) ----> B (one side for association from A)
   (each A goes to at most one B)
   (each B can come from many A's)

This is conventionally called a **Many-to-One** relationship when thinking of it as mapping entities from A to entities in B.
*   A1 -> B1
*   A2 -> B1
*   A3 -> B2
Here, many A's ({A1, A2}) map to one B (B1). Each A maps to only one B.

The wording "An entity in A is associated with at most one entity in B" means A participates with cardinality (0,1) or (1,1) towards B. The statement "An entity in B...can be associated with any number (zero or more) of entities in A" means B participates with cardinality (0,N) or (1,N) towards A.

If the relationship is R(A,B):
From A's side: one A maps to at most one B.
From B's side: one B maps to zero or more A's.

This is a Many-to-One relationship when viewed from A to B (many instances of A can relate to one instance of B).
It is a One-to-Many relationship when viewed from B to A (one instance of B can relate to many instances of A).

The standard naming convention often considers the maximum cardinalities on both sides.
A (max 1) ----- (max N) B
This is usually termed one-to-many *from the perspective of the "one" side to the "many" side*.
So, from B to A is one-to-many. From A to B is many-to-one.

Given the options:
*   Option (a) "One-to-many": This would mean a relationship where one entity from the "first" set (implicitly A here, or the "one" side of the relationship name) relates to many from the "second" set.
*   Option (d) "Many-to-one": This would mean a relationship where many entities from the "first" set (implicitly A) relate to one from the "second" set (B). This fits the description perfectly.

Conclusion: The description matches a **Many-to-One** relationship from A to B.

### Question 21:

**Convert the following infix expression into its equivalent postfix expression.**
`(A + B * D)/(E – F)+G`
Typo in image: `(A + B AD)/(E – F)+G`, seems to be `(A + B * D)/(E – F)+G`

Let's assume `(A + B * D)/(E – F)+G`.
Precedence: `*` and `/` have higher precedence than `+` and `–`. Parentheses dictate order. Associativity is left-to-right for operators of the same precedence.

1.  Innermost parentheses / highest precedence first.
    *   `B * D` -> `BD*`
    *   Expression becomes: `(A + BD*)/(E – F)+G`

2.  Next, the expressions within parentheses:
    *   `A + BD*` -> `ABD*+` (Postfix: operand operand operator)
    *   `E – F` -> `EF–`
    *   Expression becomes: `(ABD*+)/(EF–)+G`

3.  Next, the division operator `/`:
    *   `(ABD*+) / (EF–)` -> `ABD*+EF–/`
    *   Expression becomes: `ABD*+EF–/ + G`

4.  Finally, the addition operator `+`:
    *   `ABD*+EF–/ + G` -> `ABD*+EF–/G+`

So, the postfix expression is **`ABD*+EF–/G+`**.

Let's check the options provided (which seem to be based on the typo `B AD`):
Original in image (assuming `AD` is multiplication or concatenation, let's treat `*`):
`(A + B*D)/(E – F)+G`

Options given:
*   a) `(ABDA+EF-/ G+)` - incorrect format, has parentheses.
*   b) `(ABD+AE F-/G+)` - incorrect format.
*   c) `(ABDA+EF/-G +)` - incorrect format.
*   d) `(ABDEF+A/- G+)` - incorrect format.

There seems to be a major issue with the format of the options; they still contain parentheses and are not valid postfix expressions. Postfix expressions do not use parentheses to denote order of operations.

Let's assume the question means to select the correct postfix if the options were correctly formatted.
My derived postfix for `(A + B * D)/(E – F)+G` is `ABD*+EF–/G+`.

Let's try to match any part or structure if the options were mangled representations of a postfix string.
Given the options are all malformed, I cannot select one.
However, if I must choose the closest *intended* characters based on my derivation `ABD*+EF–/G+`:
None of the options directly match this sequence even if parentheses were ignored.

Let's analyze the operations in the options if they were meant to be steps or a different infix:
The options are highly garbled. Let's assume the question expects the postfix of `(A + B*D)/(E-F) + G`.
Option a: `ABDA+EF-/G+` -> The `A` after `BD` seems like `*` was intended `D*A` or `DA*`.
If it was `(A + B*D)/(E-F)+G`
My result: `A B D * + E F – / G +`

If the infix was `(A + (B*D))/(E-F) + G`:
1. `B*D` => `BD*`
2. `A + BD*` => `ABD*+`
3. `E-F` => `EF-`
4. `(ABD*+)/(EF-)` => `ABD*+EF-/`
5. `ABD*+EF-/ + G` => `ABD*+EF-/G+`

There seems to be a symbol `A` used instead of `*` in the options, like `B AD` means `B * D`.
If we take `(A + B*D)/(E-F)+G` and substitute `*` with `A` in my result, it doesn't match.
The options are fundamentally incorrect representations of postfix expressions.

However, if we look at option (b) parts: `ABD+A` as `ABD*+`. And `EF-/`. And `G+`.
This would imply:
`ABD+A` -> `(A+B)*D` (if A means multiply) or `A+(B+D)`
This is too much guesswork.

Given that the options are not in valid postfix form, there's no correct answer to choose. I will note this. The question asks to "Convert...into its equivalent postfix expression," but the options are not postfix expressions.

*If* I had to guess what a correct option might look like based on my derivation `ABD*+EF–/G+`, and if some characters in the options were meant to be operators:
Let's ignore the parentheses in the options and see if the string matches.
a) `ABDA+EF-/G+` -> If the first `A` is `*`: `ABD*+EF-/G+`. This matches my derivation exactly!
It seems option (a) has a typo and should be `ABD*+EF-/G+` and the parentheses should be removed.

Let's assume options are:
a) `ABDA+EF-/G+` (Interpreting the second 'A' as '*') -> `ABD*+EF-/G+`
b) `ABD+AEF-/G+` (Interpreting the second 'A' as operator, E also?)
c) `ABDA+EF/-G+`
d) `ABDEF+A/-G+`

If option (a) is interpreted as `AB D [*] A [+] E F – / G +`:
No, the first D is an operand. So, `A B D A [+] ...`. If the internal `A` means `*`: `A B D * + E F - / G +`.
This matches `ABD*+EF-/G+`.

So, with high confidence, assumption is: **Question Infix: `(A + B * D)/(E – F) + G`** and **Option (a) is a typo for `ABD*+EF-/G+`** (where the `A` between `D` and `+` in option (a) string was meant to be the `*` operator used in postfix for `B*D`, and the outer parentheses in the option text are erroneous styling).

**Tentative Answer based on interpretation:** a) (assuming it's `ABD*+EF-/G+`)

### Question 22:

**The result of preorder traversal is same as:**
*   a) Depth-first order
*   b) Breadth-first search
*   c) Topological order
*   d) Linear order

**Answer:** a) Depth-first order

**Explanation:**

*   **Preorder Traversal (of a tree):**
    1.  Visit the current node (Root).
    2.  Recursively traverse the left subtree in preorder.
    3.  Recursively traverse the right subtree in preorder.
    (Root-Left-Right)

*   **Depth-First Search/Order (DFS):** This is a graph traversal algorithm (and can be applied to trees, as trees are a type of graph). DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
    *   When DFS is applied to a tree starting from the root, and we process (visit/output) the node *before* visiting its children, this naturally produces a **preorder traversal** of the tree.
    *   Other DFS-based tree traversals include postorder (visit children then root) and inorder (visit left child, then root, then right child - for binary trees).

*   **Breadth-First Search/Order (BFS):** This algorithm explores the neighbor nodes first (nodes at the present depth level) before moving to the nodes at the next depth level. For a tree, this corresponds to a level-order traversal. **Not preorder.**

*   **Topological Order (or Topological Sort):** This is a linear ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, vertex `u` comes before vertex `v` in the ordering.
    *   While DFS can be used to find a topological sort (by outputting nodes in the reverse order of their finishing times in DFS), preorder traversal itself is not identical to a topological sort in general, though there are relationships. A preorder traversal of a tree (which is a DAG) is *a* topological sort if we consider edges as directed away from the root. However, the question asks what preorder is "the same as" more generally. Preorder is fundamentally a depth-first exploration strategy.

*   **Linear Order:** A general term for any sequence where elements are ordered one after another. Preorder, inorder, postorder, BFS, and topological sort all produce linear orderings. This is too generic.

**Conclusion:** Preorder traversal is a specific type of depth-first traversal. When people refer to "depth-first order" in the context of trees, preorder is one of the primary examples.

### Question 23:

**Queues serve major role in**
*   a) Simulation of recursion
*   b) Simulation of arbitrary linked list
*   c) Simulation of limited resource allocation
*   d) Simulation of heap sort

**Answer:** c) Simulation of limited resource allocation

**Explanation:**

*   **Queue Data Structure:** A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure. Elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue).
*   **Applications of Queues:**
    *   **Resource Sharing / Scheduling:** Queues are fundamental in operating systems for managing processes waiting for the CPU (ready queue), devices (I/O queues), or other shared resources. When a resource is limited, processes/requests wait in a queue for their turn. This is a direct simulation/management of limited resource allocation.
    *   **Asynchronous Data Transfer:** Data buffers queues (e.g., pipes, file I/O buffers).
    *   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** BFS uses a queue to keep track of nodes to visit.
    *   Customer service lines, printer queues, etc.

*   **Evaluating the options:**
    *   **a) Simulation of recursion:** Recursion is typically implemented using a **stack** (to store function call frames, local variables, return addresses). Not a queue.
    *   **b) Simulation of arbitrary linked list:** A linked list is a data structure itself. A queue can be *implemented* using a linked list, but a queue doesn't "simulate" a linked list in a general sense.
    *   **c) Simulation of limited resource allocation:** This is a classic use case. When multiple entities compete for a limited number of resources (like CPUs, printers, I/O channels), queues are used to manage the waiting entities in a fair (often FIFO) manner. For example, a print queue. **This is a strong fit.**
    *   **d) Simulation of heap sort:** Heap sort uses a **heap** data structure (which is often implemented using an array and has specific parent-child relationships, not directly a queue for its core logic). While queues might be used peripherally in some broader system involving sorting, the core heap sort algorithm doesn't primarily rely on queues for its simulation.

Therefore, the most direct and significant role of queues among the options is in managing access to limited resources.

### Question 24:

**In the worst case, the number of comparisons needed to search a singly linked list of length n for a given element is?**
*   a) log 2n
*   b) n/2
*   c) log 2n-1
*   d) n

**Answer:** d) n

**Explanation:**

*   **Singly Linked List:** A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.
*   **Searching a Singly Linked List:** To search for an element in a singly linked list, you typically have to start from the head (the first node) and traverse the list node by node, comparing the value in each node with the target element.
*   **Worst-Case Scenario:** The worst case for searching occurs when:
    1.  The element being searched for is the last element in the list.
    2.  The element being searched for is not present in the list at all.
*   **Number of Comparisons:**
    *   In either of these worst-case scenarios, you will have to visit and compare the element in every single node from the beginning to the end of the list.
    *   If the list has `n` elements, you will perform `n` comparisons in the worst case. (One comparison for each of the `n` nodes if the element is the last one, or `n` comparisons if it's not found and you traverse all `n` nodes).

*   **Other options:**
    *   `log 2n` (or `log n`): This complexity is typical for search operations in balanced tree structures (like BST, AVL, B-tree) or for binary search in a sorted array. Linked lists do not support direct access or binary search efficiently because you can only move sequentially.
    *   `n/2`: This is the average-case number of comparisons if the element is present and uniformly distributed.
    *   `log 2n-1`: Similar to log complexity, not applicable here.

Therefore, for a singly linked list, the worst-case number of comparisons for a search is `n`.

### Question 25:

**If several elements are competing for the same bucket in the hash table, what is it called?**
*   a) Diffusion
*   b) Replication
*   c) Collision
*   d) Duplication

**Answer:** c) Collision

**Explanation:**

*   **Hash Table:** A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. The hash function computes an index (often called a "bucket" address or slot) in an array where the value (or a pointer to it) can be stored.
*   **Hash Function Goal:** Ideally, a hash function should map different keys to different bucket addresses.
*   **Collision:** However, it's possible (and often probable, especially as the table fills up) that two or more different keys produce the same hash value (i.e., they map to the same bucket index). This event is called a **collision**.
*   **Collision Resolution:** When a collision occurs, strategies are needed to store and retrieve all the elements that hash to the same bucket. Common collision resolution techniques include:
    *   **Chaining (or Separate Chaining):** Each bucket in the hash table points to a linked list (or another data structure) of all elements that hashed to that bucket.
    *   **Open Addressing (or Closed Hashing):** If a collision occurs at a bucket, other buckets in the table are probed according to a specific sequence until an empty bucket is found. Examples include linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.

*   **Other options:**
    *   **a) Diffusion:** In cryptography and hashing, diffusion refers to the property that a small change in the input should cause significant changes in many parts of the output (the hash value). While related to good hash function design, it's not the term for multiple elements mapping to the same bucket.
    *   **b) Replication:** Means making copies of data, often for redundancy or availability. Not relevant here.
    *   **d) Duplication:** Means having identical copies of elements. While duplicate *keys* might lead to the same hash value, the term for different keys hashing to the same bucket is "collision." If you are inserting truly duplicate elements (same key, same value), how they are handled depends on the hash table's design (e.g., overwrite, store duplicates, or disallow). But the primary term for different keys → same bucket is collision.

Therefore, when multiple distinct keys map to the same bucket in a hash table, it's called a collision.

Okay, let's move on to Page 4.

### Question 26:

**What is the number of edges present in a complete graph having n vertices?**
*   a) (n*(n+1))/2
*   b) (n*(n-1))/2
*   c) n
*   d) Information given is insufficient

**Answer:** b) (n*(n-1))/2

**Explanation:**

*   **Complete Graph (Kₙ):** A complete graph is an undirected graph in which every distinct pair of vertices is connected by a unique edge.
*   **Number of Edges:**
    *   Consider `n` vertices. Each vertex must be connected to every other vertex.
    *   Pick one vertex. It will have an edge to the remaining `n-1` vertices.
    *   If you do this for all `n` vertices, you get `n * (n-1)` connections.
    *   However, this process counts each edge twice (once for vertex `u` to vertex `v`, and once for vertex `v` to vertex `u`). Since edges in an undirected graph are not directional in this counting context, we need to divide by 2.
    *   So, the number of edges in a complete graph with `n` vertices is `n * (n-1) / 2`.
*   This is also equivalent to the number of ways to choose 2 vertices from `n` vertices to form an edge, which is given by the combination formula "n choose 2":
    C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n-2)!) = (n * (n-1)) / 2

*   **Evaluating the options:**
    *   a) (n*(n+1))/2: This formula is for the sum of the first n integers (e.g., Gauss's sum). Not for edges in a complete graph.
    *   b) (n*(n-1))/2: This matches our derivation. **TRUE**.
    *   c) n: This would be for a cycle graph (if n>=3) or a path graph with n+1 vertices, not a complete graph.
    *   d) Information given is insufficient: The information (number of vertices, `n`) is sufficient.

### Question 27:

**Which of the following is not an in-place sorting algorithm?**
*   a) Selection sort
*   b) Heap sort
*   c) Quick sort
*   d) Merge sort

**Answer:** d) Merge sort

**Explanation:**

*   **In-Place Sorting Algorithm:** An in-place sorting algorithm is one that sorts the input elements within the original array (or data structure) without requiring significant extra space proportional to the input size. It might use a small, constant amount of auxiliary space for variables like loop counters or for swapping elements (e.g., O(1) or O(log n) auxiliary space). The key is that the space used for the output (the sorted array) overwrites the input array.
*   **Out-of-Place Sorting Algorithm:** An algorithm that requires extra space proportional to the input size (e.g., O(n)) to store elements during the sorting process.

Let's analyze the options:
*   **a) Selection Sort:** This algorithm repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and puts it at the beginning. It does this by swapping elements within the array, so it's an in-place algorithm (uses O(1) auxiliary space).
*   **b) Heap Sort:** This algorithm uses a heap data structure built from the input array. The sorting happens by repeatedly extracting the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap and placing it at the end of the sorted portion of the array. Building the heap can be done in-place, and the sorting process rearranges elements within the array. It's considered an in-place algorithm (uses O(1) auxiliary space if the heap is built in-place within the input array).
*   **c) Quick Sort:** This algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. It partitions the array and recursively sorts subarrays.
    *   The partitioning step is done in-place.
    *   The recursion uses space on the call stack. In the worst case, the stack space can be O(n) if the partitions are very unbalanced. In the average case, or with optimizations like tail recursion or an explicit stack, it can be O(log n).
    *   Because the primary work of moving elements happens within the original array and the auxiliary space is typically O(log n) for the recursion stack (or O(1) if using an iterative version with careful partitioning), Quick Sort is generally considered an in-place algorithm (though the O(log n) stack space is a nuance compared to strict O(1) in-place).
*   **d) Merge Sort:** This algorithm also uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then *merges* the two sorted halves.
    *   The merging step typically requires an auxiliary array of the same size as the subarrays being merged (e.g., O(n) for the top-level merge if merging two halves of size n/2). This temporary array is used to store the merged result before copying it back if needed (or by alternating between input/output arrays).
    *   Because of this need for an auxiliary array of size O(n) for the merge operation, standard Merge Sort is **not an in-place algorithm**. (There are in-place merge sort variants, but they are complex and often have higher constant factors or worse time complexity in practice, so "Merge Sort" usually refers to the standard out-of-place version).

Therefore, Merge Sort is the one that is typically not an in-place sorting algorithm.

### Question 28:

**The time complexity of heap sort in worst case is:**
*   a) O(log n)
*   b) O(n)
*   c) O(n log n)
*   d) O(n²)

**Answer:** c) O(n log n)

**Explanation:**

*   **Heap Sort Algorithm:**
    1.  **Build Heap (Heapify):** Convert the input array into a max-heap (or min-heap). This step takes O(n) time.
    2.  **Sort:** Repeatedly extract the maximum element (root of the max-heap) and move it to the end of the array (the sorted portion). After removing the root, the heap property is violated, so it needs to be restored (by calling heapify on the root of the reduced heap).
        *   There are `n-1` such extractions.
        *   Each extraction involves taking the root (O(1)) and then restoring the heap property (heapify-down or sift-down operation on a heap of decreasing size). The heapify-down operation takes O(log k) time, where `k` is the current size of the heap.
        *   So, this step involves `(n-1)` operations, each taking at most O(log n) time. This gives a complexity of O(n log n) for this phase.

*   **Overall Time Complexity:** The dominant step is the sorting phase.
    *   Build Heap: O(n)
    *   Sorting (n-1 extractions * O(log n) per extraction): O(n log n)
    *   Total = O(n) + O(n log n) = **O(n log n)**

*   **Worst Case, Average Case, Best Case:** Heap sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) for all cases (worst, average, and best) because the number of operations is fairly consistent regardless of the initial order of the input data. The height of the heap is always O(log n), and the main operations depend on this height.

*   **Other options:**
    *   O(log n): Too fast; single operations in heaps are logarithmic, but not the whole sort.
    *   O(n): Too fast; build-heap is O(n), but the extraction phase dominates.
    *   O(n²): This is the complexity of simpler sorts like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort (worst case), or Selection Sort. Heap sort is more efficient.

### Question 29:

**Suppose we are sorting an array of eight integers using quicksort, and we have just finished the first partitioning with the array looking like this:**
`2 5 1 7 9 12 11 10`
**Which statement is correct?**
*   a) The pivot could be either the 7 or the 9.
*   b) The pivot could be the 7, but it is not the 9.
*   c) The pivot is not the 7, but it could be the 9.
*   d) Neither the 7 nor the 9 is the pivot.

**Answer:** a) The pivot could be either the 7 or the 9.

**Explanation:**

*   **Quicksort Partitioning:** In the partitioning step of Quicksort, an element called the "pivot" is chosen. The array (or subarray) is then rearranged such that all elements smaller than the pivot are placed before it, and all elements greater than the pivot are placed after it. Elements equal to the pivot can go on either side or be grouped, depending on the specific partition scheme (e.g., Hoare's, Lomuto's). After partitioning, the pivot element is in its final sorted position.

*   **State of the array after first partitioning:** `2 5 1 7 9 12 11 10`
    *   Let's assume the pivot is `p`. After partitioning, all elements to the left of `p` (in its final position) should be `<= p`, and all elements to the right should be `>= p` (or strictly < and > depending on the scheme and handling of duplicates). The pivot `p` itself will be in its correct sorted place.

*   **Testing potential pivots:**
    *   **If 7 were the pivot:**
        *   Elements to its left: `2 5 1`. All are `< 7`. (OK)
        *   Elements to its right: `9 12 11 10`. All are `> 7`. (OK)
        *   This means 7 *could have been* the pivot, and it landed in its correct sorted position.
    *   **If 9 were the pivot:**
        *   Elements to its left: `2 5 1 7`. All are `< 9`. (OK)
        *   Elements to its right: `12 11 10`. All are `> 9`. (OK)
        *   This means 9 *could have been* the pivot, and it landed in its correct sorted position.
    *   **If any other element were the pivot:**
        *   For example, if 1 was the pivot: It's not in its sorted position (7, 9, etc. are to its right but are larger, while 2, 5 are also larger but on its left already - the partitioning would look different).
        *   If 12 was the pivot: Elements to its left (`2 5 1 7 9`) are all smaller, but it's not at the end, and 11, 10 are to its right but smaller. This is not a valid partitioned state around 12 as the pivot.

*   **Conclusion:** Both 7 and 9 satisfy the condition that all elements to their left are smaller and all elements to their right are larger. This means either of them could have been chosen as the pivot in the first partitioning step, and the partitioning process would have placed them in their current positions, which are their final sorted positions relative to the other elements shown.

Therefore, the pivot could have been 7, or it could have been 9.

### Question 30:

**Consider a situation where swap operation is very costly. Which of the following sorting algorithms should be preferred so that the number of swap operations are minimized in general?**
*   a) Heap Sort
*   b) Selection Sort
*   c) Insertion Sort
*   d) Merge Sort

**Answer:** b) Selection Sort

**Explanation:**

*   **Swap Operation Cost:** If swapping elements is expensive (e.g., if the elements are large objects and swapping involves moving a lot of data, or if writes to memory are slow), we want an algorithm that minimizes the number of swaps.

*   **Analyzing swaps in different algorithms:**
    *   **a) Heap Sort:** Involves swaps during the heapify process and when extracting elements. The number of swaps can be significant, related to O(n log n) in some cases, though it's generally efficient in terms of comparisons.
    *   **b) Selection Sort:**
        *   In each pass `i` (from 0 to n-2), Selection Sort finds the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array (from index `i` to `n-1`).
        *   It then swaps this minimum element with the element at the current position `i`.
        *   This results in exactly **one swap per pass** (if the element is not already in place).
        *   Therefore, Selection Sort performs at most `n-1` swaps (or O(n) swaps) in total. This is the minimum number of swaps required in the general case where elements are not already sorted, as each element (except possibly one) might need to be moved to its correct position.
    *   **c) Insertion Sort:** In the worst case (e.g., a reverse-sorted array), Insertion Sort can perform O(n²) swaps (or shifts, which are akin to swaps in terms of data movement). Each element might be shifted across many preceding elements.
    *   **d) Merge Sort (standard version):** Merge sort is typically out-of-place and involves copying data to auxiliary arrays and back. While not "swaps" in the same sense as in-place algorithms, it involves a lot of data movement (O(n log n) data movements/copies). If we're strictly counting direct swaps in an in-place context, standard Merge Sort isn't the best comparison here, but its data movement is high.

*   **Conclusion:** Selection Sort is known for minimizing the number of swaps. It performs O(n) swaps, which is optimal in terms of the number of elements that *must* be moved if the array is not already sorted. Other algorithms like Bubble Sort (worst case O(n²) swaps) or even Quick Sort (can vary, but often more than O(n) swaps) typically perform more swaps than Selection Sort.

Therefore, if swap operations are very costly, Selection Sort is often preferred due to its minimal O(n) swaps.

### Question 31:

**Match the following.**
(a) Immediate address mode (1) Local variables
(b) Direct address mode (2) Relocatable programs
(I) Indirect address mode (This looks like a typo, should be (c)) (3) Pointer
(d) Index addressing mode (4) Locality of reference
(I) Base address mode (This looks like typo, should be (e)) (5) Arrays
(f) Relative address mode (6) Constant Operands

**Options for matching (a, b, c, d, e, f) to (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6):**
a) a6 b1 c3 d5 e2 f4
b) a5 b4 c6 d3 e1 f2
c) a3 b5 c2 d4 e1 f2 (Typo in OCR? Looks like c1:a3 b5 c2 d4 e1 f2)
d) a6 b5 c2 d3 e1 f4 (Typo in OCR? Looks like f2 not f4: a6 b5 c2 d3 e1 f2)

Let's assume the list is (a, b, c, d, e, f) where (c) is Indirect, (e) is Base.

**Explanation of Addressing Modes and their uses:**

*   **(a) Immediate Address Mode:** The operand itself is part of the instruction.
    *   Use: For **constants** or small literal values.
    *   Matches: **(6) Constant Operands**. So, `a → 6`.

*   **(b) Direct Address Mode (Absolute Addressing):** The instruction contains the actual memory address of the operand.
    *   Use: Accessing static global variables whose addresses are known at compile/link time. Can be used for some simple variable access. `Local variables` typically use stack-based addressing.
    *   If `Local variables` (1) are on the stack, they are often accessed via a frame pointer plus an offset (which could be considered a form of base-register addressing or displacement). Simple global variables could be direct though.
    *Let's hold on this for a moment as other matches might be clearer.*

*   **(c) Indirect Address Mode:** The instruction contains the address of a memory location, which in turn contains the address of the operand (a pointer).
    *   Use: Implementing **pointers**.
    *   Matches: **(3) Pointer**. So, `c → 3`.

*   **(d) Index Addressing Mode:** The effective address is calculated by adding a constant displacement (offset) to the contents of an index register.
    *   Use: Accessing elements of **arrays**. The index register holds the current index (or a base multiplied by index), and the displacement could be the base address of the array.
    *   Matches: **(5) Arrays**. So, `d → 5`.

*   **(e) Base Address Mode (Base Register Addressing):** The effective address is calculated by adding a displacement (offset, usually part of the instruction) to the contents of a base register.
    *   Use: Supporting **relocatable programs** (where the program can be loaded anywhere in memory; the base register holds the starting address of the program segment). Also used for accessing fields in records/structs when the base register points to the start of the record. Accessing local variables on a stack frame (where frame pointer is in a base register).
    *   Matches: **(2) Relocatable programs**. Could also fit **(1) Local variables** (using a frame pointer).

*   **(f) Relative Address Mode (PC-Relative Addressing):** The effective address is calculated by adding a displacement (offset) to the current value of the Program Counter (PC).
    *   Use: For short jumps and branches, especially in position-independent code. Relates to accessing code or data near the current instruction. This helps with code that can be loaded at different memory locations. It exhibits **locality of reference** because the accessed locations are often close to the current instruction.
    *   Matches: **(4) Locality of reference** (as it often accesses nearby locations). Also supports relocatable code segments.

Let's try to fit the remaining:
We have:
`a → 6`
`c → 3`
`d → 5`

Remaining modes: (b) Direct, (e) Base, (f) Relative
Remaining uses: (1) Local variables, (2) Relocatable programs, (4) Locality of reference

*   (e) Base address mode is strongly associated with (2) Relocatable programs. Also, stack-based `Local variables` (1) often use a base register (frame pointer or stack pointer) plus an offset.
*   (f) Relative address mode improves `Locality of reference` (4) and aids in relocatability.

Let's consider (b) Direct address mode: This is for fixed addresses. Not ideal for typical local variables (which are on a dynamic stack) or relocatable programs. It's simpler.
If (1) Local variables are accessed via a base register (like a frame pointer) + offset, then (e) Base address mode fits (1).
If (e) Base address mode is used for (2) Relocatable programs, then (1) Local variables needs another fit.
If (f) Relative is for (4) Locality of reference.

Let's review typical pairings:
*   Immediate -> Constants (a-6)
*   Indirect -> Pointers (c-3)
*   Indexed -> Arrays (d-5)
*   Base Register -> Code/Data segment relocation, struct members (e-2 or e-1)
*   PC-Relative -> Short branches, position-independent code, Locality (f-4)
*   Direct -> Global static variables (less common for local variables directly due to stack)

If local variables (1) are considered to be on the stack and accessed via a frame pointer (which acts as a base register), then `e → 1`.
This would leave (b) Direct address mode and (2) Relocatable programs, (4) Locality of reference.
Direct addressing doesn't inherently help with relocatable programs.

Let's try option (a) from the choices: `a6 b1 c3 d5 e2 f4`
*   (a) Immediate → (6) Constant Operands. (Matches)
*   (b) Direct → (1) Local variables. (Possible if they are static local variables at fixed conceptual addresses, or simple globals which might be what's implied if base addressing is used for stack locals. However, stack locals are more dynamically addressed).
*   (c) Indirect → (3) Pointer. (Matches)
*   (d) Index → (5) Arrays. (Matches)
*   (e) Base address → (2) Relocatable programs. (Strong match).
*   (f) Relative → (4) Locality of reference. (Strong match).

This combination `a6, c3, d5, e2, f4` looks very solid.
The only slightly weaker link is `b1` (Direct → Local variables). Stack-based local variables are usually accessed via a base register (like a frame pointer for stack frames) plus an offset, making Base Addressing a better fit for them in general. However, "local variables" is broad. If we consider truly static local variables, their addresses could be fixed.

Let's consider the options again, assuming (c) is Indirect and (e) is Base.
Option (a): a6, b1, c3, d5, e2, f4.
*   a-6 Immediate - Constant: OK
*   b-1 Direct - Local Variables: Potentially OK for *some types* of local variables (e.g., static locals not on the dynamic stack, or if "local" is used loosely for module-level statics). More typically, local variables on stack use Base displacement.
*   c-3 Indirect - Pointer: OK
*   d-5 Index - Arrays: OK
*   e-2 Base address - Relocatable programs: OK. Base addressing is key for this.
*   f-4 Relative - Locality of reference: OK. PC-relative addressing exploits this.

This seems like the most plausible matching given common uses. If local variables are on the stack, they are often `[FramePointer + offset]`, which is Base-Displacement (a form of Base Addressing). If `e` (Base) is paired with `2` (Relocatable), then `b` (Direct) for `1` (Local variables) is less ideal than `e` for `1`.

Let's check if another option provides a better global fit.
If local variables (1) are best fit by Base Addressing (e), and Relocatable programs (2) is also by Base Addressing (e), then `e` has two strong candidates. This suggests we need to distribute.
Base addressing (e) for Relocatable programs (2) is very standard.
PC-Relative (f) for Locality of reference (4) is also standard (branches to nearby code).

What if `(1) Local variables` are those within a procedure, typically on the stack, accessed via `Stack_Pointer/Frame_Pointer + offset`. This *is* Base-Displacement addressing, so `e -> 1` would be a good fit.
If `e -> 1` (Base -> Local variables):
Then what for `(2) Relocatable programs`? Base addressing is also key here. PC-relative addressing (f) also helps.
What about `(b) Direct address mode`? This is for absolute, fixed addresses. Not good for relocatable code or typical stack variables. Can be used for fixed global variables.

Let's re-examine `a6 b1 c3 d5 e2 f4`.
*   a-6: Immediate - Constant (Good)
*   c-3: Indirect - Pointers (Good)
*   d-5: Indexed - Arrays (Good)
*   e-2: Base - Relocatable programs (Good)
*   f-4: Relative - Locality of reference (Good)
*   b-1: Direct - Local Variables (This is the weakest link if local variables are on the stack. If they are static locals with fixed addresses, it's okay. Many simple compiler examples might use direct addressing for non-stack variables.)

Let's consider option (c) in the OCR `a3 b5 c2 d4 e1 f2` (assuming it's meant for a list like (a)Immediate (b)Direct (c)Indirect (d)Indexed (e)Base (f)Relative).
*   a-3: Immediate - Pointer (No, immediate is an operand/value directly).
This option is immediately problematic.

The OCR for the options themselves is a bit messy and might have errors.

Let's assume option (a) `a6 b1 c3 d5 e2 f4` refers to:
(a) Immediate mode -> (6) Constant Operands
(b) Direct mode -> (1) Local variables
(I) Indirect mode -> (3) Pointer (Assuming I is (c))
(d) Index mode -> (5) Arrays
(I) Base mode -> (2) Relocatable programs (Assuming I is (e))
(f) Relative mode -> (4) Locality of reference

This set of pairings is mostly strong except for b-1 if local variables are strictly dynamic stack variables. However, in the absence of a better comprehensive fit from other permutations (which are hard to guess from the mangled OCR), this is the most consistent one. "Local variables" without further qualification could refer to static locals.

Given the high quality of the matches a-6, c-3, d-5, e-2, f-4, the b-1 pairing is likely the intended one to complete the set, even if nuanced.

### Question 32:

**Search concept used in associative memory is:**
*   a) Parallel search
*   b) Sequential Search
*   c) Binary Search
*   d) Selection search

**Answer:** a) Parallel search

**Explanation:**

*   **Associative Memory (Content-Addressable Memory - CAM):** Associative memory is a special type of computer memory that is accessed by its content rather than by an explicit memory address. When a search key (data word) is provided to associative memory, it simultaneously compares this key with all stored words in the memory.
*   **Search Mechanism:**
    *   The key feature of CAM is its ability to perform a **parallel search**. All memory locations are searched concurrently in hardware.
    *   If a match is found, the associative memory typically returns some associated data or indicates the location(s) of the match.
*   **Comparing with other options:**
    *   **b) Sequential Search:** This involves checking items one by one in a sequence until a match is found or the list ends. This is how you search a linked list or an unsorted array. CAM is much faster.
    *   **c) Binary Search:** This efficient search algorithm requires the data to be sorted and allows logarithmic time search. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. CAM does not require stored data to be sorted for searching, and its search is parallel, not divide-and-conquer in this way.
    *   **d) Selection search:** "Selection search" is not a standard term for a search algorithm. Selection sort is a sorting algorithm.

Therefore, the fundamental search concept in associative memory is **parallel search** due to its hardware architecture.

### Question 33:

**Memory interleaving is done to:**
*   a) Increase the amount of logical memory
*   b) Reduce memory access time
*   c) Simplify memory interfacing
*   d) Reduce page faults

**Answer:** b) Reduce memory access time

**Explanation:**

*   **Memory Interleaving:** A technique used to improve memory performance by dividing main memory into multiple independent modules or banks. Consecutive words (or blocks of words) of memory are stored in different modules.
*   **How it works:**
    *   When the CPU requests a sequence of memory words (e.g., fetching an instruction or data block), these consecutive words often fall into different memory modules due to interleaving.
    *   This allows multiple memory modules to be accessed concurrently (in a pipelined fashion). While one module is completing an access, another module can begin its access for the next word in the sequence.
*   **Goal:**
    *   The primary goal of memory interleaving is to **reduce the effective memory access time** by increasing memory bandwidth. It allows the memory system to service multiple requests faster than if all requests had to go to a single, slower memory module sequentially. It helps to bridge the speed gap between the CPU and main memory.

*   **Evaluating the options:**
    *   **a) Increase the amount of logical memory:** Interleaving is about how physical memory is organized and accessed; it doesn't by itself increase the total logical address space available to the CPU (that's determined by the CPU's address bus width and memory management unit).
    *   **b) Reduce memory access time:** This is the correct answer. By allowing parallel access to different memory banks, the overall throughput is increased, and the average time to access a block of data is reduced.
    *   **c) Simplify memory interfacing:** Interleaving can actually make the memory controller and interfacing logic slightly more complex because it needs to manage access to multiple banks and route addresses appropriately.
    *   **d) Reduce page faults:** Page faults occur when requested data is not in main memory. Memory interleaving speeds up access *to main memory* when data *is* there. It doesn't directly affect the likelihood of a page fault occurring (which is related to memory allocation, page replacement algorithms, program locality, and the amount of RAM).

### Question 34:

**Which of the following DMA transfer modes and interrupt handling mechanisms will enable the highest I/O bandwidth?**
*   a) Transparent DMA and Polling interrupts
*   b) Cycle-Stealing and Vectored interrupts
*   c) Block Transfer and vectored interrupts
*   d) Block transfer and Polling interrupts

**Answer:** c) Block Transfer and vectored interrupts (or potentially Cycle-Stealing with Vectored Interrupts, depending on interpretation, but Block Transfer is generally best for bandwidth)

**Explanation:**

*   **DMA (Direct Memory Access):** A feature that allows I/O devices to transfer data directly to or from main memory without involving the CPU in every byte/word transfer, thus freeing up the CPU for other tasks and increasing I/O throughput.

*   **DMA Transfer Modes:**
    *   **Burst Mode (or Block Transfer Mode):** The DMA controller gains control of the system bus and transfers an entire block of data in a single continuous burst. During this time, the CPU is idle (cannot use the bus). This mode provides the highest I/O bandwidth because the bus is dedicated to the DMA transfer.
    *   **Cycle Stealing Mode:** The DMA controller gains control of the system bus for one or a few bus cycles at a time, transferring one or a few words of data, then releases the bus to the CPU. This interleaves CPU and DMA operations. It slows down the CPU less than burst mode but provides lower DMA throughput than burst mode for a large block.
    *   **Transparent Mode (or Hidden DMA):** The DMA controller only transfers data when the CPU is not using the bus (e.g., during instruction decoding if the bus is free). This mode has the least impact on CPU performance but also the lowest DMA throughput, as it depends on bus availability.

*   **Interrupt Handling Mechanisms:**
    *   **Polling:** The CPU repeatedly checks the status of the I/O device to see if it's ready or if an operation has completed. This wastes CPU time.
    *   **Interrupts:** The I/O device signals the CPU (via an interrupt request) when it needs attention (e.g., data ready, operation complete). This is more efficient than polling.
        *   **Vectored Interrupts:** The device identifies itself when it interrupts, allowing the CPU to directly jump to the specific interrupt service routine (ISR) for that device. This is faster than non-vectored interrupts where the CPU might have to poll devices to find out which one caused the interrupt.

*   **Achieving Highest I/O Bandwidth:**
    *   For DMA transfer mode, **Block Transfer (Burst Mode)** provides the highest bandwidth because it transfers a large amount of data continuously once it has the bus.
    *   For interrupt handling, **Vectored Interrupts** are generally more efficient than polling for signaling the completion of a DMA operation (or errors), as they reduce CPU overhead in identifying the interrupt source.

*   **Evaluating the options:**
    *   **a) Transparent DMA and Polling interrupts:** Transparent DMA is the slowest DMA mode. Polling is inefficient. Low bandwidth.
    *   **b) Cycle-Stealing and Vectored interrupts:** Cycle-stealing is better than Transparent DMA, but not as high bandwidth as Block Transfer for large blocks. Vectored interrupts are good.
    *   **c) Block Transfer and vectored interrupts:** Block Transfer DMA offers the highest data transfer rate. Vectored interrupts are efficient for handling the completion signal. This combination is excellent for high I/O bandwidth.
    *   **d) Block transfer and Polling interrupts:** Block transfer is good for bandwidth, but Polling for completion is less efficient than interrupts.

**Conclusion:** Block Transfer DMA combined with an efficient interrupt mechanism like Vectored Interrupts will generally enable the highest I/O bandwidth. Cycle stealing is also good but typically Block Transfer allows for higher peak rates for the duration of the block.

Therefore, (c) is the best choice.

### Question 35:

**Consider the following sequence of micro-operations.**
`MBR ← PC`
`MAR ← X`
`PC ← Y`
`Memory ← MBR` (This line looks like a typo from the OCR of page 5, question "Memory - MBR" which is an operation, not a micro-op target. Let's assume this micro-op is actually related to writing what's in MBR to memory, or it's a misinterpretation).

Let's re-examine the sequence carefully as presented just above Q35 on page 4:
`MBR ← PC`
`MAR ← X`
`PC ← Y`

And then there's "Memory - MBR" *below* this list of three micro-operations, which is related to Q36.
So, Q35 refers to the three micro-ops:
1. `MBR ← PC` (Move contents of Program Counter to Memory Buffer Register)
2. `MAR ← X` (Move contents of variable/address X to Memory Address Register)
3. `PC ← Y` (Move contents of variable/address Y to Program Counter)

The question (from page 5, as it's cut off on page 4) is:
"**Which one of the following is a possible operation performed by this sequence ?**" (This applies to Q35 itself)
*   a) Instruction fetch
*   b) Operand fetch
*   c) Conditional branch
*   d) Initiation of interrupt service

Let's see what these micro-operations might achieve together:

1.  `MBR ← PC`: The current value of the PC (which points to the next instruction to be fetched, or could be an address to be saved) is loaded into the MBR. The MBR is typically used to hold data being transferred to/from memory.
2.  `MAR ← X`: An address `X` is loaded into the MAR. This usually precedes a memory read from address `X` (data goes to MBR) or a memory write to address `X` (data comes from MBR).
3.  `PC ← Y`: The PC is updated to a new address `Y`. This is characteristic of a jump or branch, or setting the PC to the start of an interrupt service routine.

Let's analyze the options for the sequence `MBR ← PC; MAR ← X; PC ← Y`:

*   **a) Instruction fetch:**
    A typical instruction fetch sequence is:
    `MAR ← PC`  (Load current PC into MAR)
    `Memory Read` (Initiate memory read, instruction goes from Memory[MAR] to MBR)
    `IR ← MBR`  (Move instruction from MBR to Instruction Register)
    `PC ← PC + 1` (Increment PC, or to next instruction address)
    The given sequence `MBR ← PC` is unusual for the start of a standard fetch (usually PC goes to MAR). `MAR ← X` then prepares to access memory at `X`. `PC ← Y` is a jump. This doesn't look like a standard complete instruction fetch.

*   **b) Operand fetch:**
    If `X` is the address of an operand, then `MAR ← X` followed by a `Memory Read` (then `MBR ← Memory[MAR]`) would be an operand fetch. The given sequence doesn't complete this. `MBR ← PC` and `PC ← Y` seem unrelated to fetching an operand from address `X`.

*   **c) Conditional branch:**
    A conditional branch involves checking a condition. If true, `PC ← BranchTargetAddress`. If false, `PC ← PC + 1`.
    The micro-op `PC ← Y` is a jump, which is part of a branch. However, the sequence doesn't show condition checking. But perhaps this is the *execution* part of an *unconditional* jump, or the *taken* part of a conditional one. `MBR ← PC` could be saving the current PC (return address) if this were a subroutine call. `MAR ← X` is still an odd fit unless X is related to the branch mechanism itself which is not evident.

*   **d) Initiation of interrupt service:**
    When an interrupt occurs and is acknowledged, the CPU typically needs to:
    1.  **Save the current state**, minimally the Program Counter (PC) and possibly Program Status Word (PSW). The PC value (address of the next instruction in the interrupted program) must be saved so that execution can resume later. This saved PC is often pushed onto a stack or stored in a specific memory location.
    2.  **Load the PC with the starting address of the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**. This address is often obtained from an interrupt vector table.

    Let's see if the given micro-operations fit this:
    1.  `MBR ← PC`: The current PC is copied into the MBR. This PC value (the return address) needs to be saved to memory.
    2.  `MAR ← X`: If `X` is the memory address where the PC (now in MBR) should be saved (e.g., a specific stack location an interrupt controller points to, or a dedicated memory cell for a particular interrupt type), this sets up the address for saving the PC.
        *Missing step here would be a memory write: `Memory[MAR] ← MBR` or `Memory[X] ← MBR`.*
    3.  `PC ← Y`: If `Y` is the starting address of the Interrupt Service Routine, this loads the PC to begin executing the ISR.

    This sequence `MBR ← PC; MAR ← X (to specify where MBR is written); PC ← Y (ISR start address)` *strongly suggests* the initial steps of handling an interrupt, specifically saving the PC and then jumping to the ISR. The missing `Memory[X] ← MBR` is a crucial write operation, but the preparation steps are there.

    Let's compare "Initiation of interrupt service" with the other options again.
    *   The `PC ← Y` operation is a jump.
    *   The `MBR ← PC` followed by `MAR ← X` seems to be preparing to *store* the current PC (from MBR) into location `X`. This saving of the PC is characteristic of calls or interrupts.
    *   An unconditional jump instruction (like JMP Y) would just be `PC ← Y`.
    *   A subroutine call (CALL Y) would be something like: `Save PC (e.g., MBR←PC; stack_ptr←stack_ptr-1; Mem[stack_ptr]←MBR)` then `PC ← Y`.
    The given sequence feels very much like the start of an interrupt handling sequence where the return PC is being prepared for saving, and then the PC is loaded with the ISR address.

The phrasing "Initiation of interrupt service" implies the very first steps the hardware/microcode takes after detecting and deciding to service an interrupt. Saving the current PC is a primary one, then loading the ISR address.

Let's reconsider the options if the *full* sequence from Image 5 (Q36) `Memory ← MBR` is meant to be part of Q35.
If the sequence for Q35 is actually:
1. `MBR ← PC`
2. `MAR ← X`
3. `PC ← Y`
4. `Memory[MAR] ← MBR` (assuming this is what "Memory ← MBR" implies, using the address in MAR)

Then:
1. `MBR ← PC` (put current PC in buffer)
2. `MAR ← X` (address X is where PC will be stored)
3. `Memory[X] ← MBR` (Store PC at address X)
4. `PC ← Y` (Jump to new location Y)

This sequence (1, 2, then the assumed 4, then 3) is:
Save PC at memory location X, then jump to Y.
This is EXACTLY what happens in a subroutine call (X would be the stack, Y the subroutine address) OR in an interrupt service initiation (X would be a dedicated save location or stack, Y the ISR address).

Given "Initiation of interrupt service" (d) as an option, this sequence (`MBR ← PC; MAR ← X; Memory[X] ← MBR; PC ← Y`) is a very good fit.
The original Program Counter is saved (so the interrupted program can resume), and then the Program Counter is loaded with the address of the interrupt service routine.

What if X and Y are context specific?
If Y is the address of the ISR and X is the location to save PC (e.g., a specific stack location determined by the interrupt controller, or a fixed memory location associated with the interrupt type).

This is much stronger than "instruction fetch" or "operand fetch".
It's more specific than just "conditional branch". A conditional branch might just be `PC <- target` if taken. The PC saving part makes it lean towards a call or interrupt.

Given the options, (d) is the most comprehensive operation described by these micro-steps if the memory write is assumed or implied.

Let's stick to the three micro-ops given for Q35 *on page 4*:
1. `MBR ← PC`
2. `MAR ← X`
3. `PC ← Y`
The operation "Memory ← MBR" is on the *next page* physically and seems associated with Q36.
So, for Q35, we only consider the first three.

Without the memory write, `MBR ← PC` and `MAR ← X` *prepares* to save PC to location X, but doesn't do it. Then `PC ← Y` jumps.
This still points towards saving the context (PC) and then transferring control.
This preparation is integral to initiating an interrupt service.

Let's reconsider the options.
a) Instruction fetch: No. PC usually goes to MAR.
b) Operand fetch: No. X would be operand address, then memory read. PC ops seem distinct.
c) Conditional branch: Only `PC ← Y` is part of it. `MBR ← PC` and `MAR ← X` are not typical for a simple branch unless it's a branch-and-link type of instruction where PC is saved. "Branch-and-link" is a type of subroutine call.
d) Initiation of interrupt service: This involves saving PC and loading ISR address.
    `MBR ← PC` (PC to be saved is now in MBR)
    `MAR ← X` (X is address where MBR, i.e., old PC, *will be* stored. Step missing: Mem[X] <- MBR)
    `PC ← Y` (Y is address of ISR, so jump to ISR)
Even without the explicit write, the *intent* to save PC at X and then jump to Y is very clear in the first two steps preparing for the save and the third step making the jump. This sequence is the setup for interrupt servicing.

No other option fits as well. The "initiation" part means the beginning steps.

Final Check for the exact options text matching the image.
The image indeed shows the sequence for Q35 as:
MBR ← PC
MAR ← X
PC ← Y
And Q36 starts with "Memory ← MBR".

So, applying to the 3 micro-ops for Q35:
The answer is most likely **d) Initiation of interrupt service**. The sequence strongly suggests preparing to save the current PC (by loading it into MBR and setting MAR to a save location X) and then loading the PC with a new address Y (the ISR). The actual memory write of MBR to Memory[X] would be the next micro-op in a full sequence but these are the initial, characteristic steps.

---
Okay, we're moving to Page 5. It seems there might be a bit of formatting ambiguity from the OCR around the start of this page with the line "Memory ← MBR". I will address the clearly numbered questions. If "Memory ← MBR" and its associated question "Which one of the following is a possible operation performed by this sequence?" was intended as a distinct question or a direct continuation of Q35 leading to a different answer for Q35, the problem formatting makes it ambiguous.

Typically, such a sequence (from Q35: `MBR ← PC; MAR ← X; PC ← Y` followed by `Memory[MAR] ← MBR`) describes saving the old Program Counter to a memory location `X` and then jumping to a new location `Y`. This is fundamental to subroutine calls and interrupt handling. Thus, "Initiation of interrupt service" or "Subroutine call execution" would be fitting descriptions for the combined sequence. Since "Initiation of interrupt service" was an option for Q35, it remains a strong candidate if the sequence is combined.

Let's proceed assuming Q36 is the next distinct question.

### Question 36:

**Register renaming is done in pipelined processors**
*   a) as an alternative to register allocation at compile time
*   b) for efficient access to function parameters and local variables
*   c) to handle certain kinds of hazards
*   d) as part of address translation

**Answer:** c) to handle certain kinds of hazards

**Explanation:**

*   **Register Renaming:** A technique used in high-performance pipelined processors (especially those with out-of-order execution capabilities) to eliminate certain data hazards called **false dependencies** (also known as name dependencies: Write-After-Read (WAR) and Write-After-Write (WAW) hazards).
*   **Hazards in Pipelined Processors:**
    *   **Data Hazards:** Occur when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that is not yet complete.
        *   **Read-After-Write (RAW) / True Dependency:** An instruction tries to read an operand before a previous instruction writes to it. (Handled by forwarding/bypassing or stalling).
        *   **Write-After-Read (WAR) / Anti-Dependency:** An instruction tries to write to a register before a previous instruction reads from it. This is a false dependency because the instructions don't actually exchange data; they just happen to use the same register name.
        *   **Write-After-Write (WAW) / Output Dependency:** An instruction tries to write to a register before a previous instruction writes its own result to the same register. Also a false dependency.
*   **How Register Renaming Works:**
    The processor dynamically allocates physical registers from a pool of available registers to the architectural registers (the registers named in the instruction set, like R1, R2, etc.) used by instructions.
    When an instruction that writes to an architectural register enters the pipeline (or is decoded/issued), it's assigned a new unique physical register to store its result. Subsequent instructions that need to read that specific result are directed to this new physical register.
    This breaks the false dependencies (WAR and WAW) because different instances of writes to the same architectural register are now directed to different physical registers.
*   **Evaluating the options:**
    *   **a) as an alternative to register allocation at compile time:** Register allocation is done by the compiler to assign variables to architectural registers. Register renaming is a dynamic hardware technique done at runtime. They are complementary, not alternatives.
    *   **b) for efficient access to function parameters and local variables:** While registers are used for these, register renaming's primary purpose isn't about the *efficiency of access* in this sense, but about resolving hazards for concurrent instruction execution.
    *   **c) to handle certain kinds of hazards:** This is the correct answer. Specifically, it handles WAR and WAW hazards (false dependencies), enabling more parallelism and out-of-order execution.
    *   **d) as part of address translation:** Address translation (virtual to physical addresses) is handled by the Memory Management Unit (MMU), not directly by register renaming.

### Question 37:

**Which of the following DMA transfer modes and interrupt handling mechanisms will enable the highest I/O bandwidth?**
*   .a) Transparent DMA and Polling interrupts
*   b) Cycle-Stealing and Vectored interrupts
*   c) Block Transfer and vectored interrupts
*   d) Block transfer and Polling interrupts

**Answer:** c) Block Transfer and vectored interrupts

**Explanation:** This question is identical to Q34 from Page 4. My apologies if the previous analysis was from a misread that this was Q37 already.
*   **DMA Transfer Modes for Bandwidth:**
    *   **Block Transfer (Burst Mode):** The DMA controller takes control of the bus and transfers an entire block of data in one go. This offers the highest throughput as the bus is dedicated to this transfer.
    *   **Cycle Stealing:** DMA gets the bus for shorter periods, transferring a word or a few words. CPU gets slowed down less, but peak DMA bandwidth is lower than Block Transfer.
    *   **Transparent DMA:** DMA transfers only when the CPU isn't using the bus. Lowest impact on CPU, but also lowest DMA bandwidth.
*   **Interrupt Handling Efficiency:**
    *   **Vectored Interrupts:** When an I/O operation completes, the device sends an interrupt. With vectored interrupts, the device also provides information (a vector) that directly points the CPU to the correct interrupt service routine. This is fast.
    *   **Polling:** The CPU repeatedly checks the device status. This is inefficient as it wastes CPU cycles.
*   **Conclusion for Highest I/O Bandwidth:** The combination of **Block Transfer DMA** (for maximum data transfer rate once the bus is acquired) and **Vectored Interrupts** (for efficient signaling of completion without CPU overhead of polling) generally provides the highest I/O bandwidth.

### Question 38:

**A cache has a 64 KB capacity, 128-byte lines (blocks), and is 4-way set associative. The system containing the cache uses 32-bit addresses. How many lines (blocks) and sets does the cache have?**
*   a) 64
*   b) 128
*   c) 256
*   d) 32

This question asks for two values: number of lines and number of sets. The options are single numbers, which implies they might be asking for one or assuming one leads to the other being obvious, or it's a poorly formed MCQ option set. Let's calculate both.

**Calculations:**

1.  **Cache Capacity:** 64 KB = 64 * 2¹⁰ bytes = 2⁶ * 2¹⁰ bytes = 2¹⁶ bytes.
2.  **Line Size (Block Size):** 128 bytes = 2⁷ bytes.
3.  **Associativity (k-way):** 4-way set associative (k=4). This means each set contains 4 lines.
4.  **System Address Size:** 32 bits. (This is relevant for tag/index/offset bits, but not directly for total lines/sets if capacity and line size are given).

**Number of Lines (Blocks) in the Cache:**
Number of Lines = Cache Capacity / Line Size
Number of Lines = (2¹⁶ bytes) / (2⁷ bytes/line) = 2⁽¹⁶⁻⁷⁾ lines = 2⁹ lines.
2⁹ = 512 lines.

**Number of Sets in the Cache:**
Number of Sets = Number of Lines / Associativity
Number of Sets = 512 lines / 4 lines/set = 128 sets.

So, the cache has:
*   **512 lines (blocks)**
*   **128 sets**

Now let's look at the options: a) 64, b) 128, c) 256, d) 32.
The options are single numbers. They likely refer to one of the asked quantities.

*   If it's asking for the number of lines, the answer is 512.
*   If it's asking for the number of sets, the answer is 128.

Option **(b) 128** matches the number of sets we calculated.
It's possible the question implies "How many X and Y does the cache have?" and the options are for Y (number of sets) if X (number of lines) is not directly listed. Often, the number of sets is a key parameter derived.

Let's assume the question expects one of the computed values that is present in the options.
The number of sets is 128, which is option (b).
The number of lines is 512, which is not an option.

This implies the question, by providing these options, is likely targeting the **number of sets**, or the question is flawed if it expects both and only gives options for one. Given "lines (blocks) and sets", it's plural. However, MCQs often pick one aspect if space is limited.

If the question implicitly asks for "number of sets", then (b) is correct.
If the question wanted "number of lines" and 512 was an option, that would be it.

Given the options, the most reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for a value that *is* among the options, and our calculated number of sets (128) matches option (b).

**Answer:** b) 128 (This would be the number of sets. The number of lines is 512).
The question is poorly phrased if it expects both but offers only one in the options. Assuming it's asking for the number of sets (128) or potentially the number of lines *per set* (which is 4, not an option) or some other interpretation that fits an option. The most standard derived value that matches an option is the **number of sets**.

It could be that the options are for "number of sets" primarily, and secondarily "number of lines in a way that fits an option".
No, "How many lines (blocks) and sets" requires values for both.
If it was "How many lines OR sets.." that would be different.
The question means "Number of lines = ? AND Number of sets = ?".
Number of Lines = 512.
Number of Sets = 128.
Since 128 is an option, it's possible the question will accept an answer that provides *one correct value* from the pair if the options are single values.

Let's re-read carefully: "How many lines (blocks) and sets does the cache have?" The options are single numbers. This format is often used when one answer logically implies the other or one is considered primary. Here, the number of sets (128) is option (b).

Final decision: The number of sets is 128.

### Question 39:

**A machine with N different opcodes can contain how many different sequences of micro-operations.**
The wording is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean:
1.  For *each* of the N opcodes, how many sequences of micro-operations can define it? (This would depend on the complexity of each opcode).
2.  If we have a set of available micro-operations, and we want to form sequences for N different opcodes, what's the total number of *possible* distinct micro-operation sequences the *machine's control unit can generate in total* to implement these N opcodes? (Still too vague).
3.  Is it asking about the number of possible micro-instructions if micro-instructions have fields that can select one of N opcodes? (Unlikely).

Let's look at the options which are usually indicative of the expected type of answer for such abstract questions:
a) 2ᴺ
b) Nᴺ
c) N²
d) N

This implies a combinatorial or mapping relationship.

"A machine with N different opcodes..."
Each opcode (like ADD, LOAD, JUMP) is implemented by a sequence of micro-operations (e.g., fetch operands, perform ALU op, store result).

If the question means: "How many different micro-operation sequences are there *in total* in the control unit to implement all N opcodes?"
*   The answer would simply be "the sum of the lengths of all micro-operation sequences for each of the N opcodes" if it means the total count of micro-ops. But the options are not sums.
*   Or, "how many *distinct sequences* are defined?" If each of the N opcodes has *one unique sequence* of micro-operations defining it, then there are **N** such distinct sequences. This matches option (d).

Let's consider other interpretations:
*   Could it relate to encoding? If N opcodes need to be encoded in a micro-instruction field, you'd need log₂(N) bits. Not relevant to "sequences".
*   "can contain how many different sequences of micro-operations."
    *   If each of the N opcodes *is* a sequence, then there are N sequences.
    *   If "sequences of micro-operations" refers to some abstract building block, and N opcodes are built from these...

What if the question is simpler: A machine *has* N different opcodes. Each opcode is implemented by *its own sequence* of micro-operations. How many such implementing sequences are there? There would be N of them, one for each opcode.

Option choices:
*   (d) N: This seems the most plausible if each opcode corresponds to one defined sequence that implements it.
*   (c) N²: If each opcode interacted with every other opcode to form a sequence (unlikely for basic definitions).
*   (b) Nᴺ: If you had N types of micro-operations, and you form sequences of length N using them, this is too complex.
*   (a) 2ᴺ: Suggests a power set or binary choice for each opcode, doesn't fit directly.

Let's assume the simplest interpretation: The machine is designed to execute N specific opcodes. Each of these opcodes has a corresponding sequence of micro-operations that the control unit executes when that opcode is encountered. Therefore, the control unit *contains* (or can generate) **N** different sequences of micro-operations, one for each of the N defined instruction opcodes.

**Answer:** d) N

### Question 40:

**How many 32K x 1 RAM chips are needed to provide a memory capacity of 256K-bytes?**

**Calculations:**

1.  **Target Memory Capacity:** 256 K-bytes
    *   1 KiloByte (KB) = 2¹⁰ bytes = 1024 bytes.
    *   256 K-bytes = 256 * 1024 bytes.
    *   In terms of bits: 256 K-bytes = 256 * 1024 * 8 bits.
        256 = 2⁸
        1024 = 2¹⁰
        So, 256 K-bytes = 2⁸ * 2¹⁰ * 2³ bits = 2²¹ bits.

2.  **RAM Chip Capacity:** 32K x 1 RAM chip
    *   This means the chip has 32K addressable locations (rows/words), and each location stores 1 bit.
    *   32K = 32 * 2¹⁰ = 2⁵ * 2¹⁰ = 2¹⁵.
    *   So, one chip has a capacity of 2¹⁵ locations * 1 bit/location = 2¹⁵ bits.

3.  **Number of Chips Needed:**
    Number of Chips = (Total Memory Capacity in bits) / (Capacity of one chip in bits)
    Number of Chips = (2²¹ bits) / (2¹⁵ bits/chip)
    Number of Chips = 2⁽²¹⁻¹⁵⁾ chips = 2⁶ chips.
    2⁶ = 64.

So, 64 chips are needed.

### Question 41:

**Which of the following will not be accepted by the following DFA?**
The DFA has:
*   States: Initial State, Dumping State, Final State.
*   Alphabet: Seems to be {a, b} from the transitions.
*   Transitions:
    *   From Initial State:
        *   `a` → Final State
        *   `b` → Dumping State
    *   From Final State:
        *   `a` → Dumping State
        *   `b` → Initial State
    *   From Dumping State:
        *   `a` → Dumping State
        *   `b` → Dumping State (Once in Dumping State, it stays there)

Dumping State is a non-accepting trap state. Final State is an accepting state. Initial State is non-accepting unless a path leads to Final State.

Let's trace the given strings:

*   **a) ababaabaa**
    1.  `a`: Initial → Final (Accepting)
    2.  `b`: Final → Initial
    3.  `a`: Initial → Final (Accepting)
    4.  `b`: Final → Initial
    5.  `a`: Initial → Final (Accepting)
    6.  `a`: Final → Dumping (Non-accepting)
    Since it ends in Dumping State after the 6th 'a', this string **will not be accepted**. Let's verify.
    `a`: I → F (current state F)
    `ab`: F --b--> I (current state I)
    `aba`: I --a--> F (current state F)
    `abab`: F --b--> I (current state I)
    `ababa`: I --a--> F (current state F)
    `ababaa`: F --a--> DUMP (current state DUMP)
    `ababaab`: DUMP --b--> DUMP (current state DUMP)
    `ababaaba`: DUMP --a--> DUMP (current state DUMP)
    `ababaabaa`: DUMP --a--> DUMP (current state DUMP)
    Ends in Dumping State. **Not Accepted.**

*   **b) abbbaa**
    1.  `a`: Initial → Final
    2.  `b`: Final → Initial
    3.  `b`: Initial → Dumping
    4.  `b`: Dumping → Dumping
    5.  `a`: Dumping → Dumping
    6.  `a`: Dumping → Dumping
    Ends in Dumping State. **Not Accepted.**

*   **c) abbbaabb**
    1.  `a`: Initial → Final
    2.  `b`: Final → Initial
    3.  `b`: Initial → Dumping
    4.  `b`: Dumping → Dumping
    5.  `a`: Dumping → Dumping
    6.  `a`: Dumping → Dumping
    7.  `b`: Dumping → Dumping
    8.  `b`: Dumping → Dumping
    Ends in Dumping State. **Not Accepted.**

*   **d) abbaabbaa**
    1.  `a`: Initial → Final
    2.  `b`: Final → Initial
    3.  `b`: Initial → Dumping
    4.  `a`: Dumping → Dumping
    5.  `a`: Dumping → Dumping
    6.  `b`: Dumping → Dumping
    7.  `b`: Dumping → Dumping
    8.  `a`: Dumping → Dumping
    9.  `a`: Dumping → Dumping
    Ends in Dumping State. **Not Accepted.**

It seems all the given options end up in the Dumping state based on my tracing of option (a).
This means my trace for (a) might have been for a different string, or the question is "Which... will be accepted" by mistake, or all these are indeed not accepted and there's a simpler one.

Let's re-trace option (a) `ababaabaa` more carefully for its state just before it would be rejected.
`a`: I → F (State F)
`ab`: F → I (State I)
`aba`: I → F (State F)
`abab`: F → I (State I)
`ababa`: I → F (State F)
`ababaa`: F → DUMP (State DUMP) -> From here, it stays in DUMP. So `ababaabaa` is NOT accepted.

This implies that if the question is "Which of the following will not be accepted", and I find one that is *not* accepted, that should be the answer.
The issue is, if *multiple* options are not accepted, which one is *the* answer?
Usually, such questions have three accepted strings and one not accepted, or vice versa.

What kind of strings does this DFA accept?
To be accepted, a string must end in the Final State.
*   `a` -> F (Accepted)
*   `ab` -> I
*   `aba` -> F (Accepted)
*   `abb` -> DUMP (Not Accepted)
*   `aa` -> DUMP (Not Accepted)

*   If in Final state (after an 'a' that didn't come from 'F--a-->D'):
    *   Next 'a' goes to Dumping (rejected).
    *   Next 'b' goes to Initial. From Initial, an 'a' goes to Final (accepted). So `aba`, `ababa` are accepted.
Pattern for accepted strings: Seems to be strings ending in 'a', where the 'a' transitioned from Initial to Final, and it wasn't preceded by an 'a' that sent it to Dump, or a 'b' that sent it to Dump.
Essentially, you need an odd number of 'a's not interrupted by 'b' taking you to dump or 'a' taking you to dump from Final.
No, this is simpler. You keep cycling I --a--> F --b--> I --a--> F --b--> I ...
Accepted if it ends in F. This happens if the last character processed correctly leads to F.
A string like `(ab)*a` would be accepted. Example: `a`, `aba`, `ababa`.
Any 'aa' sequence or 'bb' sequence seems problematic.
If current_char is 'a':
  If state == Initial, state = Final.
  If state == Final, state = Dumping.
If current_char is 'b':
  If state == Initial, state = Dumping.
  If state == Final, state = Initial.

Accepted strings: `a`, `aba`, `ababa`, `abababa`, ... ( (ab)*a )

Let's re-check the options against this understanding:
*   **a) ababaabaa**
    `a` -> F
    `ab` -> I
    `aba` -> F
    `abab` -> I
    `ababa` -> F
    `ababaa`: F --a--> DUMP. Stays in DUMP. String `ababaabaa` ends in DUMP. **Not Accepted.**

*   **b) abbbaa**
    `a` -> F
    `ab` -> I
    `abb`: I --b--> DUMP. Stays in DUMP. String `abbbaa` ends in DUMP. **Not Accepted.**

*   **c) abbbaabb** (This will also hit dump on `abb` and stay there). **Not Accepted.**

*   **d) abbaabbaa** (This will also hit dump on `abb` and stay there). **Not Accepted.**

All four example strings are NOT accepted by this DFA. This is a problematic question if it expects a unique answer.
Could there be a typo in the DFA diagram in my understanding or in the question's options?
The DFA is:
I: --a--> F, --b--> D
F: --a--> D, --b--> I
D: --a--> D, --b--> D
(F is final state)

This DFA accepts strings of the form `(ab)*a`.
Length 1: `a` (Acc)
Length 2: `aa` (Rej), `ab` (Rej, ends in I)
Length 3: `aaa` (Rej), `aab` (Rej), `aba` (Acc), `abb` (Rej)
Length 4: `aaaa` (Rej), `aaab` (Rej), `aaba` (Rej), `aabb` (Rej), `abaa` (Rej), `abab` (Rej, ends in I)
Length 5: `ababa` (Acc)

Let's check the options character by character again.

*   **a) ababaabaa**
    I --a--> F
    F --b--> I
    I --a--> F
    F --b--> I
    I --a--> F  (ababa - ends F, so if string stopped here, it's accepted)
    F --a--> DUMP
    ... rest of string keeps it in DUMP. **Not Accepted.**

It seems my analysis that ALL options are NOT accepted is correct.
In an exam, if all options are 'not accepted' and the question is 'which will not be accepted', then any of them would be a valid answer *if the question allows for multiple correct answers*, but standard MCQs imply a single uniquely correct answer. This means there's likely an error in the question options or the intended behavior.

If the question was "Which of the following WILL be accepted?", the answer would be "none of these".
Since it is "Which will NOT be accepted?", and ALL are not accepted, the question is flawed if a single choice is expected.

However, if I had to pick the one that goes to DUMP earliest or most simply:
b) `abbbaa`: `a` (F), `ab` (I), `abb` (DUMP - rejected here).
a) `ababaabaa`: `a`(F), `ab`(I), `aba`(F), `abab`(I), `ababa`(F), `ababaa`(DUMP - rejected here).

Option (b) gets rejected on the third character. Option (a) gets rejected on the sixth character.
This doesn't make one "more not accepted." They are all simply not accepted. I will pick (a) as the first one identified if an answer must be given.

### Question 42:

**Can a DFA recognize a palindrome number?**
*   a) Yes
*   b) No
*   c) Yes, with input alphabet as ∑*
*   d) Can't be determined

**Answer:** b) No

**Explanation:**

*   **Palindrome:** A string that reads the same forwards and backward (e.g., "madam", "racecar", "12321"). A palindrome *number* would be a number whose digit sequence is a palindrome.
*   **DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton):** A finite state machine that accepts or rejects finite strings of symbols. DFAs have a finite amount of memory (represented by their states).
*   **Recognizing Palindromes:** To recognize a palindrome, a machine typically needs to:
    1.  Read the first half of the string and store it.
    2.  Read the second half of the string and compare it (in reverse order) with the stored first half.
*   **DFA Limitation:** A DFA has only a finite number of states. It cannot store an arbitrarily long first half of a string because that would require an unbounded amount of memory (or an infinite number of states to remember all possible first halves).
    *   For any given DFA, there's a limit to the length of the prefix it can "remember". If you have palindromes longer than what its finite memory can handle for comparison, it will fail.
*   **Pumping Lemma:** The Pumping Lemma for regular languages (languages recognized by DFAs) can be used to formally prove that the language of all palindromes (over an alphabet of at least two symbols) is not regular. If it's not regular, no DFA can recognize it.
*   **Specific Cases:**
    *   A DFA *can* recognize palindromes up to a certain *fixed length*. For instance, a DFA can be built to recognize all palindromes of length exactly 5. But it cannot recognize the language of *all* palindromes of *any* length.
    *   The question "Can a DFA recognize a palindrome number?" implies the general language of all palindrome numbers.
*   **Option (c) "Yes, with input alphabet as ∑*"**: ∑* represents all possible strings over an alphabet ∑. This doesn't change the fundamental memory limitation of a DFA. The alphabet itself doesn't grant unbounded memory.

Therefore, a DFA cannot recognize the general language of palindromes (or palindrome numbers) due to its finite memory.

### Question 43:

**Which of the following options is correct?**
**Statement 1: Initial State of NFA is Initial State of DFA.**
**Statement 2: The final state of DFA will be every combination of final state of NFA.**

**Answer:** (The options for a,b,c,d for Q43 were on page 5, let's assume standard True/False combinations)
The actual options listed for Q43 (from the OCR'd image, bottom of Page 5):
*   a) Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is true
*   b) Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false
*   c) Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true
*   d) Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is also false (Typo in OCR "Statement 1 can be..." likely means "Statement 1 is false...")

Let's analyze the statements in the context of converting an NFA to an equivalent DFA using the subset construction algorithm:

*   **Statement 1: Initial State of NFA is Initial State of DFA.**
    *   In the standard subset construction:
        *   The initial state of the NFA is S₀.
        *   The initial state of the equivalent DFA is usually the ε-closure of S₀ (the set of all states reachable from S₀ by zero or more ε-transitions).
        *   So, the initial state of the DFA is a *set* of NFA states, which includes the NFA's initial state (and possibly others via ε-closure). It's not just "the initial state of NFA is initial state of DFA" as a direct one-to-one singular state mapping unless there are no ε-transitions from the NFA start state and the DFA state is just {S₀}.
    *   Statement 1, as written, is imprecise. The DFA's initial state *corresponds to* or *is derived from* the NFA's initial state(s), specifically it's the set containing the NFA start state (and its epsilon closure). If the NFA has a single start state `q0`, the DFA's start state is `ε-closure({q0})`. This is a state *in the DFA*, which represents a *set of states from the NFA*.
    *   If "Initial State of NFA" refers to the single NFA state, and "Initial State of DFA" refers to the single DFA state, then they aren't the same entity directly.
    *   This statement is likely intended to be **FALSE** in its strict interpretation because the DFA state is a *set* of NFA states.

*   **Statement 2: The final state of DFA will be every combination of final state of NFA.**
    *   In subset construction, a state in the DFA (which is a set of NFA states) is marked as a final (accepting) state if *any* of the NFA states within that set is a final state of the NFA.
    *   "Every combination of final state of NFA" is not accurate. It's not about combinations. It's: "A DFA state Q = {q₁, q₂, ..., qk} (where qᵢ are NFA states) is a final state in the DFA if and only if at least one qᵢ ∈ Q is a final state in the NFA."
    *   The phrasing "every combination of final state of NFA" is confusing and doesn't accurately describe how final states are determined in the DFA. This statement is likely **FALSE**.

Let's re-evaluate Statement 1 with a more common understanding.
Statement 1: "Initial State of NFA is Initial State of DFA."
This could be interpreted as: The conceptual starting point of the NFA computation directly determines the conceptual starting point of the DFA computation.
More precisely, for an NFA N with start state q₀, the equivalent DFA M has a start state Q₀ = ε-closure({q₀}). So, Q₀ *is determined by* q₀.
If the question is loose and means the NFA's start state *is part of* the set that forms the DFA's start state (which is true), it might be considered "true" in some contexts. But if it means they are the same type of object or identical, it's false. Given the rigor usually expected, let's lean towards false.

Let's check the provided question options (if visible they might clarify intent).
The provided options are:
a) S1 true, S2 true
b) S1 true, S2 false
c) S1 is true and S2 is false (repeated) - likely typo in OCR from image, it should be S1 false, S2 true or S1 false, S2 false for (c) and (d).
Image shows this for 43:
Statement 1: Initial State of NFA is Initial State of DFA.
Statement 2: The final state of DFA will be every combination of final state of NFA.
a) Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is true
b) Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false
c) Statement 1 can be true and Statement 2 is true   (This "can be true" is weird)
d) Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is also false

Let's go with my initial assessment:
S1: (Initial state of NFA is initial state of DFA) - More accurately, the DFA's initial state is the epsilon-closure of the NFA's initial state set. So, if the NFA has start state q0, DFA start state is ε(q0). These are not "the same state". So S1 is FALSE.
S2: (The final state of DFA will be every combination of final state of NFA) - This is definitely FALSE. A DFA state (which is a set of NFA states) is final if it *contains* at least one NFA final state.

If S1 is False and S2 is False, then option (d) "Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is also false" would be the answer.

Let's see if there's any interpretation where S1 could be true. Sometimes, for simplicity, if an NFA has a start state q0 and no epsilon transitions from it, the DFA's start state is just denoted as {q0}. Is {q0} "the same as" q0? Not strictly.

Consider standard textbook definitions:
*   Initial state of DFA D: Q₀ = ε-closure(S₀) where S₀ is the set of start states of NFA N. (If N has one start state q₀, then S₀ = {q₀}).
*   Final states of DFA D: F_D = { Q | Q ∈ Q_D and Q ∩ F_N ≠ ∅ }. (A DFA state Q is final if its set of NFA states Q has at least one NFA final state from F_N).

Under these definitions:
Statement 1: "Initial State of NFA is Initial State of DFA." FALSE. (e.g., NFA start state q₀ vs DFA start state ε-closure({q₀})).
Statement 2: "The final state of DFA will be every combination of final state of NFA." FALSE. It's about containing *any* NFA final state.

So both are false. This aligns with option (d).

The option (c) "Statement 1 can be true and Statement 2 is true" is odd. "Can be true" might mean in some specific trivial cases S1 looks true (e.g. NFA start state q0 with no epsilon moves, and we loosely identify {q0} with q0). But S2 remains problematic.

Given the standard algorithm and definitions, (S1 is False, S2 is False) seems most robust.

**Answer:** d) Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is also false (assuming the option text is intended to mean both are false).

Okay, let's proceed with the final page, Page 6.

### Question 44:

**Which of the following statement is correct?**
*   a) All Regular grammar are context free but not vice versa
*   b) All context free grammar are regular grammar but not vice versa
*   c) Regular grammar and context free grammar are the same entity
*   d) None of the mentioned

**Answer:** a) All Regular grammar are context free but not vice versa

**Explanation:**

This question pertains to the Chomsky Hierarchy of formal languages and grammars.

*   **Regular Grammars (Type 3):** These generate regular languages. They have rules of the form:
    *   `A → a`
    *   `A → aB` (right-linear)
    *   OR `A → Ba` (left-linear, but not mixed with right-linear usually in one grammar)
    (where A, B are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal). Regular languages are recognized by Finite Automata (DFAs/NFAs).

*   **Context-Free Grammars (CFG - Type 2):** These generate context-free languages. They have rules of the form:
    *   `A → γ`
    (where A is a single non-terminal, and γ is any string of terminals and/or non-terminals, including the empty string ε). Context-free languages are recognized by Pushdown Automata (PDAs).

**Relationship:**
The set of regular languages is a proper subset of the set of context-free languages. This means:
1.  Every regular language can be generated by a context-free grammar (because the production rules of a regular grammar are a restricted form of CFG rules). Therefore, all regular grammars are also context-free grammars.
2.  There exist context-free languages that are not regular (e.g., the language {aⁿbⁿ | n ≥ 0}). Therefore, not all context-free grammars are regular grammars.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **a) All Regular grammar are context free but not vice versa:** This statement correctly reflects the relationship. Regular grammars are a specific, more restricted type of context-free grammar. And there are context-free grammars (and languages) that are not regular. **TRUE.**
*   **b) All context free grammar are regular grammar but not vice versa:** This is incorrect. This would imply that context-free languages are a subset of regular languages, which is the opposite of the truth. **FALSE.**
*   **c) Regular grammar and context free grammar are the same entity:** This is incorrect. They define different classes of languages with different generative power and recognizer capabilities. **FALSE.**
*   **d) None of the mentioned:** Since (a) is correct, this is false.

### Question 45:

**Suppose A→ xBz and B→y, then the simplified grammar would be:**
*   a) A→xyz
*   b) A→xBz|xyz
*   c) A→xBz|B|y
*   d) none of the mentioned

**Answer:** a) A→xyz

**Explanation:**

This question is about **substituting** a non-terminal's production into another production (a form of simplification or inlining, especially if B is only defined as B→y and isn't used elsewhere or recursively in a way that prevents this substitution).

Given:
1.  `A → xBz`
2.  `B → y`

We can substitute the production for B into the production for A:
Since `B` can be replaced by `y`, the production `A → xBz` implies that `A` can derive `x` followed by whatever `B` derives, followed by `z`.
If `B` *only* derives `y` (i.e., `B → y` is the only production for B, or it's the specific derivation path we are considering for simplification), then we can replace B with y in the rule for A.

`A → x (y) z`
`A → xyz`

This is a direct substitution.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **a) A→xyz:** This is the result of the substitution. **TRUE.**
*   **b) A→xBz|xyz:** This option keeps the original rule for A and adds the substituted one. While `A → xBz` implies `A → xyz` (if B→y), listing both might happen during certain grammar transformation steps, but if "simplified grammar" means applying the substitution, then just `A→xyz` (if B exclusively becomes y and is removed) is the result. If B has other productions or is recursive, this simplification might not be complete or might remove choices. Assuming B→y is the only way B is resolved in this context for simplification.
*   **c) A→xBz|B|y:** This is incorrect. `A` doesn't directly derive `B` or `y` based on `A→xBz`.
*   **d) none of the mentioned:** Since (a) is a direct result of substitution, this is likely false.

The term "simplified grammar" here most directly points to the result of performing the substitution of `B` with `y`. If B has other productions or is needed elsewhere, the simplification might be more complex (e.g., eliminating B if `B→y` is its only role and it's not a start symbol). Given the simplicity, `A→xyz` is the direct outcome of this specific step.

### Question 46:

**Given grammar G:**
**(1)S → AS**
**(2)S → AAS**
**(3)A → SA**
**(4)A → aa**
**Which of the following productions denies the format of Chomsky Normal Form?**
*   a) 2,4
*   b) 1,3
*   c) 1, 2, 3, 4
*   d) 2, 3, 4

**Answer:** c) 1, 2, 3, 4 (Actually, all of them except possibly (4) if interpreted carefully, but let's re-evaluate based on standard CNF rules. The most direct answer from the options will be based on rules that are *clearly* not CNF).

**Explanation of Chomsky Normal Form (CNF):**
A context-free grammar is in CNF if all of its production rules are of one of the following forms:
1.  `A → BC` (a non-terminal derives two non-terminals)
2.  `A → a` (a non-terminal derives a single terminal)
3.  `S → ε` (the start symbol S derives the empty string ε), *only if* ε is in the language, and if this rule exists, S does not appear on the right-hand side of any other production. (Most definitions handle epsilon separately by first removing epsilon productions unless the language contains epsilon).

Let's analyze the given productions:

*   **(1) S → AS**
    *   Right-hand side (RHS) has a non-terminal (A) followed by a non-terminal (S). This is of the form `A → BC`. **This rule is in CNF.**

*   **(2) S → AAS**
    *   RHS has three non-terminals (AAS). CNF rules allow only two non-terminals or one terminal on the RHS.
    *   This can be converted to CNF:
        `S → AX` (where X is a new non-terminal)
        `X → AS`
    *   So, the original rule `S → AAS` **is NOT in CNF.**

*   **(3) A → SA**
    *   RHS has a non-terminal (S) followed by a non-terminal (A). This is of the form `A → BC`. **This rule is in CNF.**

*   **(4) A → aa**
    *   RHS has two terminals ('aa'). CNF rules allow only a *single* terminal on the RHS (or two non-terminals).
    *   This can be converted to CNF:
        `A → X Y` (where X and Y are new non-terminals)
        `X → a`
        `Y → a`
        Or more commonly `A → Xₐ Xₐ` with `Xₐ → a`.
        Or `A → X₁` and `X₁ → X₂ X₃`, `X₂→a`, `X₃→a`. More directly, `A -> C_a C_a` where `C_a -> a`.
        A common conversion step for terminals in longer RHS is:
        `A → B₁B₂...Bₙ` (CNF form)
        `A → a` (CNF form)
        For `A → t₁t₂...tₘ` where `tᵢ` are terminals and m > 1, we introduce `Cᵢ → tᵢ` and then rewrite A as `A → C₁...Cₘ` which is then converted to the two-non-terminal form.
        So `A → aa` becomes `A → CₐCₐ` (with `Cₐ → a`).
    *   Thus, the original rule `A → aa` **is NOT in CNF.**

Productions that deny CNF format: (2) `S → AAS` and (4) `A → aa`.

Let's look at the options given:
*   a) 2,4 (Productions 2 and 4 are not in CNF)
*   b) 1,3 (Productions 1 and 3 are in CNF)
*   c) 1, 2, 3, 4 (This implies all are not CNF, which is incorrect as 1 and 3 are CNF)
*   d) 2, 3, 4 (This implies 3 is not CNF, which is incorrect)

Based on my analysis, productions (2) and (4) are not in CNF.
This makes option **(a) 2,4** the correct answer.

Let me re-read the question: "Which of the following productions denies the format of Chomsky Normal Form?"
It's asking for the set of productions.

Wait, I made a quick judgment on (1) and (3).
(1) `S → AS` (RHS: NonTerminal NonTerminal) → **Yes, CNF.**
(3) `A → SA` (RHS: NonTerminal NonTerminal) → **Yes, CNF.**

(2) `S → AAS` (RHS: NonTerminal NonTerminal NonTerminal) → **No, not CNF.** (Length of RHS string of non-terminals > 2)
(4) `A → aa` (RHS: terminal terminal) → **No, not CNF.** (RHS is not a single terminal, nor two non-terminals)

So, the productions that are NOT in CNF are (2) and (4).
Thus, option (a) which lists {2, 4} is correct.

Why did I previously think (c) could be an answer? Perhaps misremembering. The direct application of CNF rules shows (1) and (3) are fine, while (2) and (4) are not.

**Final Answer for Q46:** a) 2,4

### Question 47:

**What is the pumping length of string of length x?**
*   a) x+1
*   b) x
*   c) x-1
*   d) x²

**Answer:** This question is phrased very poorly and seems to misunderstand the concept of "pumping length."

**Explanation of Pumping Length (for Regular Languages):**

*   The Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages states that for any regular language L, there exists an integer `p` (called the "pumping length" or "pumping constant") such that any string `w` in L with length `|w| ≥ p` can be divided into three parts, `w = xyz`, satisfying the following conditions:
    1.  `|y| > 0` (the string `y` to be pumped is not empty)
    2.  `|xy| ≤ p` (the combined length of `x` and `y` is less than or equal to the pumping length `p`)
    3.  For all `i ≥ 0`, the string `xyⁱz` is also in L (pumping `y` zero or more times keeps the string in the language).

*   **Key Points about Pumping Length `p`:**
    *   `p` is a property of the *language* (or the DFA recognizing it, often related to the number of states in a minimal DFA). It's a constant for a given regular language.
    *   It is NOT a property of an individual string's length `x`.
    *   The lemma states that *if* a string's length (`x` in the question's terminology) is greater than or equal to this constant pumping length `p` for the language, *then* that string can be pumped.

**The question "What is the pumping length of string of length x?" is ill-posed because:**
*   The pumping length is not "of a string." It's "for a language."
*   A string itself doesn't *have* a pumping length. A string can be *pumpable* if its length is greater than or equal to the language's pumping length.

**Trying to interpret the question's intent:**
Perhaps it's asking: "If a string has length `x`, and `x` is greater than or equal to the pumping length `p` of the language, what could `p` be in relation to `x`?" This is still not right. `p` is fixed for the language.

Or maybe it's a trick question and the answer is "undefined based on the input " or related to the property `|xy| ≤ p`.
If `w` has length `x`, and `|w| = x ≥ p`, and `w=xyz` with `|xy| ≤ p`. This means the pumpable part `y` is found within the first `p` characters of the string `w`.

None of the options `x+1, x, x-1, x²` make sense as "the pumping length" *derived from* "a string of length x". The pumping length `p` is an independent characteristic of the language. If a string of length `x` is pumpable, it just means `x >= p`.

If the question is trying to ask something like, "If a language L has a pumping length p, what is a characteristic length related to pumping any string w in L where |w| >= p?", then the property `|xy| <= p` is important.

Given the options are functions of `x`, this implies the question expects `p` to be a function of `x`, which contradicts the definition of pumping length.

**Could it be a misunderstanding of terminology?**
Is "pumping length of string" supposed to mean something else? Unlikely in this context.

This seems like a flawed question. However, in some contexts related to the Pumping Lemma, when you *choose* a string `w` of length `x ≥ p` to show a contradiction, you make sure `x` is at least `p`. The Pumping Lemma tells us that the "pumpable" part `y` occurs within the first `p` symbols of `w`.

If forced to choose or find a very loose association:
The condition `|xy| ≤ p` means that the part `xy` (which contains the part `y` that gets pumped) has a length at most `p`. If the string `w` itself has length `x`, and `x ≥ p`, then the "action" of finding `y` happens within the prefix of length `p`.

This question is very difficult to answer correctly because its premise is flawed.
However, let's consider what might be a common misconception or a simplified exam context.
Perhaps the question implies `p` is somehow related to `x` by one of these options.

If the string length `x` is exactly equal to the pumping length `p` (i.e., `x=p`), then the string `w` of length `x` can be pumped. In this specific case, the pumping length `p` would be equal to `x`. This fits option (b).
This would be the case if `x` is the *shortest* string whose length is equal to or greater than `p`.

Let's assume the question implies "What is a value `p` (the pumping length for the language) such that a string of length `x` *is guaranteed to be pumpable* according to the lemma, assuming `x` is chosen appropriately?" The lemma says this happens if `x ≥ p`.
If the question is rephrased as "If `p` is the pumping length for a language L, and we select a string `w ∈ L` such that `|w| = p`, what is `|w|`?" The answer would be `p`. If `x` is this specific length (which is equal to `p`), then the answer is `x`.

This is highly speculative. Given standard choices in such contexts where questions are simplified:
Option (b) `x`: If we consider `x` to be exactly the pumping length `p` for the language, then a string of length `x` (which is `p`) is the threshold for the pumping lemma to apply.

This question likely refers to a chosen string `w` whose length is exactly the pumping length `p` for the language. So, if `|w| = x`, and `x = p`, then `p = x`.

**Tentative Answer due to poor phrasing:** b) x

### Question 48:

**The language of balanced paranthesis is:**
*   a) regular
*   b) non regular
*   c) may be regular
*   d) none of the mentioned

**Answer:** b) non regular

**Explanation:**

*   **Language of Balanced Parentheses (L_BP):** This language consists of strings of parentheses that are correctly matched. For example: `()`, `(())`, `()()`, `(()())` are in L_BP. Strings like `(()`, `)(`, `((` are not.
*   **Recognition Requirement:** To recognize if a string of parentheses is balanced, you need to keep track of the count of open parentheses minus the count of closed parentheses. This count must never be negative during the scan, and it must be zero at the end of the string.
*   **Regular Languages and Finite Automata:** Regular languages are those that can be recognized by a Finite Automaton (DFA or NFA). Finite Automata have a *finite* amount of memory (their states).
*   **Why L_BP is Not Regular:** To correctly recognize arbitrarily deeply nested parentheses (e.g., `((((....))))` with `n` open and `n` close), a machine would need to be able to count arbitrarily high. A finite automaton, with its finite number of states, cannot count to an arbitrary `n`. It can only count up to a limit determined by its number of states.
    *   This can be formally proven using the Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages. The language L_BP (e.g., strings like `(`ⁿ`)`ⁿ) can be shown to not be pumpable according to the rules for regular languages.
*   **Context-Free Language:** The language of balanced parentheses *is* a classic example of a context-free language. It can be generated by a simple context-free grammar (e.g., `S → (S)S | ε` or `S → (S) | SS | ε` or `S → (S) | () | ε`) and recognized by a Pushdown Automaton (which has a stack, providing unbounded memory for counting).

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **a) regular:** Incorrect.
*   **b) non regular:** Correct. It is a context-free language but not regular.
*   **c) may be regular:** Incorrect. It is definitively non-regular.
*   **d) none of the mentioned:** Incorrect, as (b) is correct.

### Question 49:

**Which of the problems are unsolvable?**
*   a) Halting problem
*   b) Boolean Satisfiability problem
*   c) Halting problem & Boolean Satisfiability problem
*   d) None of the mentioned

**Answer:** a) Halting problem (if asking for what is *provably undecidable* in the Turing machine sense)

**Explanation:**

*   **Unsolvable Problem (Undecidable Problem):** In computability theory, an unsolvable or undecidable problem is a decision problem for which it is proven to be impossible to construct an algorithm (a Turing machine) that always leads to a correct yes-or-no answer in a finite amount of time.

*   **a) Halting Problem:**
    *   The Halting Problem asks: Given an arbitrary program (e.g., a Turing machine) and an input to that program, will the program eventually halt (finish execution) or run forever?
    *   Alan Turing proved in 1936 that the Halting Problem is **undecidable** (unsolvable) for Turing machines. There is no general algorithm that can solve the Halting Problem for all possible program-input pairs.
    *   So, the Halting Problem is a classic example of an unsolvable problem.

*   **b) Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT):**
    *   The SAT problem asks: Given a Boolean expression (a formula in propositional logic), is there an assignment of truth values (True/False) to its variables that makes the entire expression true?
    *   SAT is **decidable**. We can, in principle, try every possible truth assignment to the variables. If there are `n` variables, there are 2ⁿ possible assignments. For each assignment, we can evaluate the expression. This is a finite (though possibly very large) number of checks. So, an algorithm exists.
    *   However, SAT is **NP-complete**. This means:
        1.  It is in NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time): If a solution (a satisfying assignment) exists, it can be verified quickly (in polynomial time).
        2.  It is NP-hard: Any problem in NP can be reduced to SAT in polynomial time.
    *   While NP-complete problems are believed to be computationally hard (likely not solvable in polynomial time on a deterministic machine, i.e., P ≠ NP is widely believed), they are still **decidable (solvable)**. "Hard to solve efficiently" is different from "impossible to solve algorithmically."

*   **c) Halting problem & Boolean Satisfiability problem:**
    *   Since the Halting Problem is unsolvable and SAT is solvable (though hard), this combined statement (implying both are unsolvable) is incorrect if it means *both individually*. If it means the *conjunction* of "Halting problem is unsolvable" AND "SAT is unsolvable", then the statement is false because SAT is solvable.

**Conclusion:**
The Halting Problem is unsolvable (undecidable).
The Boolean Satisfiability Problem is solvable (decidable), although it is NP-complete and thus computationally hard.

The question asks "Which of the problems *are* unsolvable?" (plural, suggesting there might be more than one, or it refers to selecting from the list).
Among the distinct problems listed:
*   Halting Problem: Unsolvable.
*   Boolean Satisfiability Problem: Solvable.

Therefore, the item that is clearly unsolvable is the Halting problem.
If option (c) means the *set* of problems {Halting problem, Boolean Satisfiability problem}, and asks if *all problems in this set* are unsolvable, then the answer is no, because SAT is solvable.
If option (c) is interpreted as "Are both Halting Problem AND Boolean Satisfiability Problem unsolvable?", the answer is No.

The best fit for "Which of the problems are unsolvable?" when choosing one option is the one that *is* unsolvable.

**Answer:** a) Halting problem

### Question 50:

**A language L is said to be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ if there is a turing machine M such that L(M)=L and M halts at every point.**
*   a) Turing acceptable
*   b) Decidable
*   c) Undecidable
*   d) None of the mentioned

**Answer:** b) Decidable

**Explanation:**

This question defines the concept of a decidable language (also known as a recursive language).

*   **Turing Machine (TM):** A mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine manipulating symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. It's a model for what can be computed algorithmically.
*   **L(M) = L:** This means the Turing machine M accepts the language L. That is, M halts in an accepting state for every string `w` that is in L, and M halts in a rejecting state or does not halt (runs forever) for strings not in L. This describes a **Turing-recognizable** (or recursively enumerable) language.

*   **M halts at every point (on every input):** This is a crucial additional condition. A Turing machine that halts on *all* inputs (whether the input string is in the language or not) is called a **decider** or a **total Turing machine**.
    *   If the input string `w` is in L, M halts and accepts.
    *   If the input string `w` is *not* in L, M halts and rejects.

*   **Definitions:**
    *   **Turing-acceptable (or Turing-recognizable, or Recursively Enumerable):** A language L is Turing-acceptable if there exists a Turing machine M such that L(M) = L. M must halt and accept for strings in L. For strings not in L, M may halt and reject, or it may loop forever. (This matches the first part of the question's condition: `L(M)=L`).
    *   **Decidable (or Recursive):** A language L is decidable if there exists a Turing machine M (a decider) such that L(M) = L AND M halts on *every* input string (whether in L or not). This perfectly matches the question's condition: `L(M)=L` AND `M halts at every point`.
    *   **Undecidable:** A language that is not decidable. For an undecidable language, no such always-halting Turing machine (decider) exists. This could mean it's Turing-recognizable but not decidable (like the language corresponding to the Halting Problem), or not even Turing-recognizable.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **a) Turing acceptable:** This only requires M to halt on strings *in* L. The question adds the stronger condition that M halts "at every point" (on all inputs). So, while a decidable language is also Turing acceptable, "Decidable" is a more precise fit for the given definition.
*   **b) Decidable:** This is the exact definition provided in the question. **TRUE.**
*   **c) Undecidable:** This is the opposite of what is defined.
*   **d) None of the mentioned:** Incorrect, as (b) is the definition.
