Okay, this is a comprehensive exam covering several core Computer Science topics! I'll go through each question, provide the answer, explain the concept, and then discuss related concepts to help you prepare for similar questions.

Let's break it down section by section.

**Page 1: Data Structures and Algorithms**

**Question 1: The prerequisite of the binary search algorithm is**
*   **Answer:** c) Array should be sorted in ascending order
*   **Core Concept: Binary Search**
    *   Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a **sorted** list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.
    *   **Prerequisite:** The fundamental requirement is that the array/list must be sorted. While it can work with descending order too (if the comparison logic is adjusted), ascending order is the standard assumption. "Randomly arranged" (b) is definitely wrong, and "None of these" (d) is incorrect because sorting is essential.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Time complexity of binary search: O(log n).
    *   How binary search compares to linear search (O(n)).
    *   Recursive and iterative implementations of binary search.
    *   Situations where binary search is not applicable (e.g., unsorted data, linked lists where direct middle access is inefficient).

**Question 2: In a binary heap, what is the time complexity of deleting the maximum element?**
*   **Answer:** b) O(log n)
*   **Core Concept: Binary Heap (Max-Heap)**
    *   A max-heap is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. The maximum element is always at the root.
    *   **Deleting the maximum:**
        1.  The root (max element) is removed.
        2.  The last element in the heap is moved to the root.
        3.  The heap property might be violated, so the new root is "sifted down" (heapified down) by swapping it with its largest child until the heap property is restored. This sift-down operation takes O(log n) time because the height of a heap with n elements is **log n with base 2**
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Min-heap (deleting the minimum element is also O(log n)).
    *   Time complexity of insertion into a heap: O(log n).
    *   Time complexity of finding the maximum/minimum: O(1).
    *   Building a heap from an array: O(n).
    *   Heap sort algorithm.

**Question 3: How many edges does a complete graph with n vertices have?**
*   **Answer:** b) n(n-1)/2
*   **Core Concept: Complete Graph**
    *   A complete graph K<sub>n</sub> is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.
    *   **Derivation:** Each of the `n` vertices connects to `n-1` other vertices. If you multiply `n * (n-1)`, you count each edge twice (once for each endpoint). Therefore, you divide by 2. This is also the combination "n choose 2".
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Degree of each vertex in a complete graph: n-1.
    *   Handshaking Lemma: Sum of degrees = 2 * Number of edges.
    *   Number of edges in other graph types (trees: n-1, cycles: n, bipartite graphs).
    *   Graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list).

**Question 4: The data structure used in breadth first search algorithm is**
*   **Answer:** a) queue
*   **Core Concept: Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
    *   BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores neighbor nodes first before moving to the next level neighbors. It explores "layer by layer."
    *   **Data Structure:** A **queue** (First-In, First-Out - FIFO) is used to keep track of the nodes to visit. Nodes are added to the back of the queue as they are discovered, and nodes are processed from the front of the queue. This ensures that nodes at the same level are processed before moving to deeper levels.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Depth-First Search (DFS) uses a **stack** (Last-In, First-Out - LIFO).
    *   Applications of BFS (shortest path in unweighted graphs, finding connected components).
    *   Time and space complexity of BFS: O(V+E) where V is vertices, E is edges.

**Question 5: What is the amortized time complexity of operations in a dynamic array?**
*   **Answer:** a) O(1)
*   **Core Concept: Dynamic Array & Amortized Analysis**
    *   A dynamic array (like Python lists or C++ vectors) can grow or shrink. When it's full and an element is added, it allocates a new, larger array and copies elements over (an O(N) operation).
    *   **Amortized Analysis:** Considers the average cost of an operation over a sequence of operations. While a single append *can* be O(N), most appends (when there's space) are O(1). The expensive O(N) resizes happen infrequently enough that their cost, when averaged over many operations, leads to an O(1) amortized cost for appending/popping from the end.
    *   **Note:** This O(1) amortized complexity primarily refers to `append` (add to end) and `pop` (remove from end). Insertion/deletion in the middle is still O(N) due to shifting elements. The question is a bit general, but O(1) is the common answer highlighting the efficiency of end operations.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Worst-case complexity of append: O(N).
    *   How resizing strategy (e.g., doubling capacity) affects amortization.
    *   Complexity of other dynamic array operations (get/set by index: O(1), insert/delete at arbitrary index: O(N)).

**Question 6: In a max-heap with n elements, where are the leaf nodes stored?**
*   **Answer:** b) Last level only (This is the best fit among the given options, though nuanced)
*   **Core Concept: Heap Structure & Leaf Nodes**
    *   A heap is a complete binary tree. All levels are filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
    *   **Leaf nodes** are nodes with no children.
    *   All nodes on the absolute **last (deepest) populated level** are definitely leaves.
    *   Nodes on the **second-to-last level** can *also* be leaves if the last level is not completely full (i.e., they don't have children that fall within the 'n' elements).
    *   Option (b) is the common simplification. In an array representation (0-indexed), leaves are roughly from index `floor(n/2)` to `n-1`. These nodes will occupy the last level and possibly part of the second-to-last level.
    *   (a) is wrong (root is level 0). (c) is ill-formed. (d) is wrong.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Array representation of a binary heap.
    *   Number of leaf nodes in a complete binary tree with n nodes: `ceil(n/2)`.
    *   Identifying parent/child nodes using array indices.

**Question 7: A hash table is**
*   **Answer:** d) A structure that maps keys to values
*   **Core Concept: Hash Table**
    *   A hash table (or hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index (a "hash code") into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
    *   (a) is too specific. (b) is too general. (c) has it reversed.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Hash functions (properties of good hash functions).
    *   Collision resolution techniques (chaining, open addressing).
    *   Average and worst-case time complexities for search, insert, delete (Average: O(1), Worst: O(n)).
    *   Load factor.

**Question 8: In a circular queue implemented with an array, how do you determine if the queue is full?**
*   **Answer:** b) (rear + 1) % size == front
*   **Core Concept: Circular Queue**
    *   A circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It's an efficient way to use a fixed-size array for a queue.
    *   **Full Condition:** To distinguish between a full queue and an empty queue when `rear == front` could mean either, one common approach is to consider the queue full when the next available spot for `rear` would be `front`.
        *   `(rear + 1) % size` calculates the next position for `rear` in a circular manner. If this equals `front`, the queue is full (leaving one spot empty to differentiate from an empty queue where `front == rear`).
    *   (a) `rear == front` is the condition for an *empty* queue (or can be ambiguous without careful management).
    *   (c) and (d) are not standard conditions.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Empty condition for a circular queue (typically `front == rear`).
    *   Enqueue and dequeue operations in a circular queue.
    *   Alternative full condition: using a `count` variable to track the number of elements.

**Question 9: Which of the following traversal algorithms ensures elements are visited in sorted order for a binary search tree?**
*   **Answer:** c) In-order
*   **Core Concept: Binary Search Tree (BST) Traversal**
    *   A BST has the property that for any node, all values in its left subtree are smaller, and all values in its right subtree are larger.
    *   **In-order Traversal:** Visits the left subtree, then the current node, then the right subtree (Left-Node-Right). This traversal method on a BST will always visit the nodes in ascending sorted order.
    *   **Pre-order:** Node-Left-Right.
    *   **Post-order:** Left-Right-Node.
    *   **Level-order:** Visits nodes level by level.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   How to perform each traversal type.
    *   Applications of different traversals (e.g., pre-order for copying trees, post-order for deleting trees).

**Question 10: What is the maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height h?**
- `A tree with only a root node is defined as having h=0.`
*   **Answer:** a) 2<sup>h+1</sup> - 1 (Assuming height `h` means number of levels, and root is level 0, so height `h` means levels 0 to `h`. If height `h` means `h` edges from root to furthest leaf, then the answer would be 2<sup>h+1</sup>-1 if h is number of levels, and root is level 1. Or 2<sup>h+1</sup>-1 if root is level 0 and h is the max index of the level.)
    *   Let's clarify height conventions:
        *   **Convention 1: Height is the number of levels.** If root is level 1, height `h` has `h` levels. Max nodes = 2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> + ... + 2<sup>h-1</sup> = 2<sup>h</sup> - 1.
        *   **Convention 2: Height is the number of edges on the longest path from root to a leaf.** If root is at height 0, a tree with `h` levels (root at level 0, leaves at level `h`) has height `h`. Max nodes = 2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> + ... + 2<sup>h</sup> = 2<sup>h+1</sup> - 1.
    *   Given the options, `2^(h+1) - 1` (a) fits Convention 2, where `h` is the maximum level index if the root is at level 0.
    *   Option `d) 2^h` could be the number of nodes at level `h`.
    *   Option `c) 2^(h+1)-1` is the same as `a`. *There seems to be a typo in the provided image. If (a) is 2^h - 1 and (c) is 2^(h+1)-1, then (c) is correct for convention 2.* Let's assume the question implies height as the number of levels (e.g. a tree of height 0 has 1 node (2<sup>0+1</sup>-1=1), a tree of height 1 has up to 3 nodes (2<sup>1+1</sup>-1=3)).
    *   **If the options were distinct, and `h` is the number of edges from root to furthest leaf (common definition):**
        *   A tree of height 0 (single node) has 2<sup>0+1</sup>-1 = 1 node.
        *   A tree of height 1 has max 2<sup>1+1</sup>-1 = 3 nodes.
    *   The question is phrased as "height h". Let's assume `h` is the number of edges on the longest path. Then option `c` is `2^(h+1)-1`.
    *   Let's re-examine the options based on the OCR:
        a) 2^h - 1
        b) 2^(h-1) - 1
        c) 2^(h+1) - 1
        d) 2^h
    *   If height `h` means `h` levels (root is level 1, last level is `h`): Max nodes = 2<sup>h</sup> - 1. This is option (a).
    *   If height `h` means number of edges from root to deepest leaf (root is height 0, deepest leaf is height `h`, so `h+1` levels): Max nodes = 2<sup>h+1</sup> - 1. This is option (c).
    *   This is a common point of ambiguity. Most textbooks define height as number of edges. So `h+1` levels. **So (c) is the most likely correct answer under the standard definition.**
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Minimum number of nodes in a binary tree of height h.
    *   Relationship between number of nodes and height in complete/full binary trees.

**Question 11: In a multithreaded environment, which of the following is used to avoid race conditions?**
*   **Answer:** b) Mutex
*   **Core Concept: Race Conditions & Synchronization**
    *   A **race condition** occurs when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, and the outcome of the computation depends on the unpredictable order in which their operations are interleaved.
    *   A **Mutex** (Mutual Exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that grants exclusive access to a shared resource. Only one thread can hold the mutex at a time. Other threads wanting to access the resource must wait until the mutex is released.
    *   (a) Thread Pooling manages threads but doesn't directly prevent race conditions.
    *   (c) Paging is a memory management scheme.
    *   (d) Deadlock is a problem that can arise from improper use of synchronization primitives, not a solution to race conditions.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Semaphores, Monitors, Condition Variables (other synchronization tools).
    *   Critical Section.
    *   Deadlock, livelock, starvation.

**Question 12: In a two-level directory structure, which of the following is true?**
*   **Answer:** a) Files in different directories can have the same name
*   **Core Concept: Directory Structures**
    *   **Two-Level Directory:** Each user has their own User File Directory (UFD). The system has a Master File Directory (MFD) that points to each UFD.
    *   This structure allows different users to have files with the same name because the full path name to a file is `User_X/filename`. So, `User_A/my_doc` is different from `User_B/my_doc`.
    *   (b) is incorrect; files in the *same* user directory must have unique names.
    *   (c) is incorrect; directories (UFDs) are the subdirectories of the MFD.
    *   (d) is incorrect; users typically have their own directory for multiple files.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Single-level directory structure (all files in one directory, names must be unique).
    *   Tree-structured directories (most common, allows arbitrary nesting).
    *   Acyclic-graph directories (allows sharing of files/directories).

**Question 13: A system is said to be in a deadlock state when:**
*   **Answer:** b) Processes are waiting for resources held by each other (and specifically in a circular chain)
*   **Core Concept: Deadlock**
    *   Deadlock is a state in which two or more processes are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for a resource that is held by another process in the set, forming a circular wait.
    *   The four necessary conditions for deadlock (Coffman conditions):
        1.  **Mutual Exclusion:** Resources are non-sharable.
        2.  **Hold and Wait:** A process holds at least one resource and is waiting for others.
        3.  **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process.
        4.  **Circular Wait:** A circular chain of processes exists, such that each process holds one or more resources that are being requested by the next process in the chain.
    *   (a) is too general. (c) might be a symptom but not the definition. (d) is the opposite of being blocked.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Deadlock prevention, avoidance, detection, and recovery.
    *   Resource Allocation Graph.
    *   Banker's Algorithm (deadlock avoidance).

**Question 14: In a multithreaded program, a thread takes 100 ms for computation and 10 ms for I/O. If there are 5 such threads, what is the CPU utilization?**
*   **Answer:** c) 90.9% (approx)
*   **Core Concept: CPU Utilization with I/O Overlap**
    *   If threads can perform I/O while other threads compute, the CPU can be kept busy.
    *   Total time for one thread's cycle = Computation + I/O = 100 ms + 10 ms = 110 ms.
    *   CPU busy time per thread cycle = 100 ms.
    *   CPU utilization = (CPU busy time) / (Total cycle time for the activity if perfectly overlapped)
    *   When one thread does I/O (10ms), another thread can use the CPU. With enough threads, the CPU can be kept busy for the entire 100ms computation period of other threads.
    *   In each 110ms "cycle" for a single thread's full execution path, the CPU is used for 100ms.
    *   CPU Utilization = (Time CPU is busy) / (Total Time) = 100 ms / (100 ms + 10 ms) = 100 / 110 = 10/11.
    *   10/11 ≈ 0.9090... or 90.9%.
    *   The number of threads (5) is important because it suggests there are enough threads to potentially keep the CPU busy during I/O waits of other threads. If there was only 1 thread, CPU utilization would be 100/110. With 5 threads, it's highly likely that while one thread is doing I/O, another is ready for CPU.

**Question 15: A paging system has a 3-level page table. If the first, second, and third levels occupy 1 KB each, what is the minimum memory needed to store the page tables for a process with 2 MB of virtual memory and 4 KB page size?**
*   **Answer:** b) 4 KB
*   **Core Concept: Multi-Level Paging**
    *   Virtual Memory = 2 MB = 2 * 2<sup>20</sup> Bytes
    *   Page Size = 4 KB = 4 * 2<sup>10</sup> Bytes = 2<sup>2</sup> * 2<sup>10</sup> = 2<sup>12</sup> Bytes
    *   Number of pages = Virtual Memory / Page Size = (2 * 2<sup>20</sup>) / 2<sup>12</sup> = 2 * 2<sup>8</sup> = 2<sup>9</sup> = 512 pages.
    *   Each entry in the third-level page table points to a page frame. We have 512 pages, so we need 512 entries in the third-level tables.
    *   Size of each page table (level 1, 2, or 3) = 1 KB.
    *   **Minimum memory needed:**
        1.  **Level 1 Page Table:** We always need one of these for the process. Size = 1 KB.
        2.  **Level 2 Page Table(s):** The level 1 table points to level 2 tables. At minimum, we only need to allocate level 2 tables that are actually referenced. If only one entry in the level 1 table is used (e.g., the process uses a small, contiguous portion of its address space), we might only need one level 2 table. Size = 1 KB.
        3.  **Level 3 Page Table(s):** The level 2 table(s) point to level 3 tables. Similarly, we might only need one level 3 table if the address space usage is localized. Size = 1 KB.
    *   The question asks for *minimum memory*. This occurs if the 2MB of virtual memory is used in such a way that it only requires a single path through the 3-level page table structure to address all necessary pages.
        *   For 512 pages, we need 512 entries at the lowest level (level 3).
        *   If a level 3 page table is 1KB, and let's assume each Page Table Entry (PTE) is 4 bytes (a common size to hold a frame number and control bits), then one level 3 table can hold 1KB / 4B = 1024 / 4 = 256 entries.
        *   To address 512 pages, we'd need 512 / 256 = 2 third-level page tables. Total = 2 * 1KB = 2KB for level 3.
        *   These 2 third-level tables would need 2 entries in a second-level page table. This easily fits within one 1KB second-level page table. Total = 1KB for level 2.
        *   This one second-level page table needs 1 entry in the first-level page table. This fits within one 1KB first-level page table. Total = 1KB for level 1.
        *   Minimum memory = 1KB (L1) + 1KB (L2) + 2KB (L3) = **4 KB**.

    *   Calculating the number of entries per page table.
    *   How virtual addresses are translated using multi-level page tables.
    *   Inverted page tables.

**Question 16: In a system with multiple processes, which synchronization mechanism ensures mutual exclusion?**
*   **Answer:** a) Semaphore (specifically a binary semaphore used as a mutex)
*   **Core Concept: Mutual Exclusion**
    *   Mutual exclusion is a property of concurrency control, ensuring that no two processes or threads can be in their critical section (accessing a shared resource) at the same time.
    *   **Semaphore:** A semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes. A binary semaphore (can only be 0 or 1) can function as a mutex.
    *   (b) Paging is memory management.
    *   (c) Spooling is for managing I/O to devices like printers.
    *   (d) Deadlock is a problem, not a mechanism for mutual exclusion.
    *   *Note: A Mutex is a more direct answer if it were an option and distinct from Semaphore. Since Mutex was an option in Q11, and Semaphore is here, Semaphore is the best fit for this general question.*

**Question 17: A system has 5 processes and 3 resource types... [Banker's Algorithm type problem]**
*   **To solve this, we need to apply the Banker's Algorithm safety algorithm.**
    Let P = {P0, P1, P2, P3, P4}
    Let R = {R0, R1, R2} (assuming 3 resource types A, B, C)

    Allocation:
    P0:
    P1:
    P2:
    P3:
    P4:
    Total Allocated = [1+0+1+1+0, 0+1+3+0+0, 2+0+5+0+1] =

    Request (this should be `Need` or `Max - Allocation` if `Max` were given. The question labels it `Request`, which implies future requests, but for safety, we need `Need`):
    The problem is underspecified if "Request" is the current outstanding request. For Banker's, we need `Max` or `Need`.
    Let's assume "Request" represents the `Need` matrix (Max - Allocation). If it's current requests, the problem is different.
    **Assuming "Request" is the "Need" matrix:**
    Need:
    P0: (This implies P0 has all it needs, or Max for P0 was)
    P1:
    P2:
    P3:
    P4:

    Available:
    Work = Available =
    Finish = [F, F, F, F, F]

    1.  **P0:** Need<sub>0</sub> = <= Work =. Yes.
        Work = Work + Allocation<sub>0</sub> = + =
        Finish = [T, F, F, F, F]. Safe sequence: <P0>

    2.  **P1:** Need<sub>1</sub> = <= Work =. Yes.
        Work = Work + Allocation<sub>1</sub> = + =
        Finish = [T, T, F, F, F]. Safe sequence: <P0, P1>

    3.  **P2:** Need<sub>2</sub> = <= Work =. Yes.
        Work = Work + Allocation<sub>2</sub> = + =
        Finish = [T, T, T, F, F]. Safe sequence: <P0, P1, P2>

    4.  **P3:** Need<sub>3</sub> = <= Work =. Yes.
        Work = Work + Allocation<sub>3</sub> = + =
        Finish = [T, T, T, T, F]. Safe sequence: <P0, P1, P2, P3>

    5.  **P4:** Need<sub>4</sub> = <= Work =. Yes.
        Work = Work + Allocation<sub>4</sub> = + =
        Finish = [T, T, T, T, T]. Safe sequence: <P0, P1, P2, P3, P4>

    Since a safe sequence exists, the system is in a safe state.
*   **Answer:** a) Safe
*   **Core Concept: Banker's Algorithm (Safety Algorithm)**
    *   Used for deadlock avoidance.
    *   A state is safe if there is some sequence by which all processes can complete their execution even if they all request their maximum resources.
    *   The algorithm checks if `Need[i] <= Work` for some process `i`. If yes, it assumes process `i` completes, releases its resources (`Work = Work + Allocation[i]`), and `Finish[i] = true`. Repeat until all processes are finished or no such process can be found.

**Question 18: Consider a paging system with a page size of 4 KB. How many bits are used for the offset in a 32-bit address?**
*   **Answer:** b) 12 bits
*   **Core Concept: Paging & Address Translation**
    *   A logical address in a paging system is divided into two parts: a page number and a page offset.
    *   Page Size = 4 KB = 4 * 1024 Bytes = 2<sup>2</sup> * 2<sup>10</sup> Bytes = 2<sup>12</sup> Bytes.
    *   The offset bits are used to address individual bytes within a page. The number of offset bits is `log_2(Page Size)`.
    *   Number of offset bits = log<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>12</sup>) = 12 bits.
    *   A 32-bit address means: Total bits = 32.
    *   Page number bits = Total bits - Offset bits = 32 - 12 = 20 bits.

**Question 19: What is the primary purpose of an operating system?**
*   **Answer:** b) To manage system resources
*   **Core Concept: Purpose of an Operating System (OS)**
    *   An OS acts as an intermediary between the user/applications and the computer hardware.
    *   **Primary purposes:**
        1.  **Resource Management:** Managing CPU, memory, I/O devices, files, etc., and allocating them to various programs and users.
        2.  **Providing an Interface:** Offering a user interface (CLI, GUI) and an application programming interface (API) for programs to interact with the hardware.
        3.  **Execution Environment:** Providing a platform for software to run.
    *   (a) is too low-level; the OS abstracts hardware.
    *   (c) Compilers are separate system software.
    *   (d) Debuggers are tools; the OS might provide support for them but it's not its primary purpose.

**Question 21: A CPU has a clock cycle time of 2 ns and executes a program with 1 billion instructions. The CPI of the processor is 1.5. What is the total execution time?**
*   **Answer:** a) 3 s
*   **Core Concept: CPU Performance Calculation**
    *   Clock Cycle Time (T) = 2 ns = 2 * 10<sup>-9</sup> s
    *   Number of Instructions (I) = 1 billion = 1 * 10<sup>9</sup> instructions
    *   Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) = 1.5
    *   Total Cycles = I * CPI = (1 * 10<sup>9</sup>) * 1.5 = 1.5 * 10<sup>9</sup> cycles.
    *   Total Execution Time (CPU Time) = Total Cycles * Clock Cycle Time
        = (1.5 * 10<sup>9</sup> cycles) * (2 * 10<sup>-9</sup> s/cycle)
        = 1.5 * 2 s = 3 s.

**Question 22: In a 4-way set associative cache, the total cache size is 64 KB and block size is 16 bytes. What is the number of sets in the cache?**
*   **Answer:** a) 256
*   **Core Concept: Cache Memory Organization**
    *   Total Cache Size = 64 KB = 64 * 2<sup>10</sup> Bytes = 2<sup>6</sup> * 2<sup>10</sup> = 2<sup>16</sup> Bytes.
    *   Block Size (Line Size) = 16 Bytes = 2<sup>4</sup> Bytes.
    *   Associativity (k-way) = 4-way.
    *   Number of Cache Lines = Total Cache Size / Block Size
        = 2<sup>16</sup> / 2<sup>4</sup> = 2<sup>12</sup> = 4096 lines.
    *   Number of Sets = Number of Cache Lines / Associativity
        = 4096 / 4 = 1024 / 1 = 2<sup>12</sup> / 2<sup>2</sup> = 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 sets.
    *   **Wait, re-calculating Number of Sets:**
        Number of Sets = (Total Cache Size) / (Block Size * Associativity)
        Number of Sets = (64 * 1024 Bytes) / (16 Bytes * 4)
        Number of Sets = (65536 Bytes) / (64 Bytes/Set)
        Number of Sets = 1024 sets.
    *   Looking at the options: 256, 1024, 2048, 512. My calculation leads to 1024.
    *   Let's re-verify the formula.
        Cache Size = Number of Sets * Associativity * Block Size
        Number of Sets = Cache Size / (Associativity * Block Size)
        Number of Sets = (64 * 1024) / (4 * 16) = 65536 / 64 = 1024.
    *   The OCR for option (a) is 256. It seems my calculation (1024) matches option (b). Let me double check the question parameters.
        Total cache size: 64 KB
        Block size: 16 bytes
        Associativity: 4-way
        Number of cache lines = 64KB / 16B = (64 * 1024) / 16 = 4 * 1024 = 4096 lines.
        Number of sets = Number of lines / Associativity = 4096 / 4 = 1024 sets.
    *   **It seems option (b) 1024 is correct based on standard formulas.** Perhaps there's an error in the provided options matching my derivation of `a) 256`. If (b) is indeed 1024, then (b) is the answer.
    *   Assuming the options are as scanned:
        a) 256, b) 1024, c) 2048, d) 512.
        **The answer is 1024. This corresponds to option (b).**

**Question 23: Which of the following addressing modes is used in the instruction MOV AX, [BX]?**
*   **Answer:** c) Register Indirect Addressing
*   **Core Concept: Addressing Modes**
    *   Addressing modes specify how the effective address of an operand is calculated.
    *   **MOV AX, [BX]:** This instruction moves the content of the memory location whose address is stored in the `BX` register into the `AX` register.
    *   **Register Indirect Addressing:** The instruction specifies a register (here, `BX`) which contains the *address* of the operand in memory.
    *   (a) Register Addressing: Operand is directly in a register (e.g., `MOV AX, BX`).
    *   (b) Direct Addressing: Operand's memory address is directly in the instruction (e.g., `MOV AX, [1234h]`).
    *   (d) Immediate Addressing: Operand's value is directly in the instruction (e.g., `MOV AX, 1234h`).

**Question 24: A computer has 16 GB of RAM and a 32-bit virtual address space. If the page size is 4 KB, what is the size of the page table?**
*   **Answer:** d) 32 MB (This assumes a single-level page table and specific PTE size)
*   **Core Concept: Page Table Size Calculation**
    *   Virtual Address Space = 32-bit.
    *   Total Virtual Memory = 2<sup>32</sup> Bytes.
    *   Page Size = 4 KB = 2<sup>12</sup> Bytes.
    *   Number of Virtual Pages = Total Virtual Memory / Page Size
        = 2<sup>32</sup> / 2<sup>12</sup> = 2<sup>20</sup> pages.
    *   The page table needs one entry for each virtual page. So, 2<sup>20</sup> entries.
    *   Size of each Page Table Entry (PTE): This is not given, but it's crucial. A common PTE size is 4 Bytes (to store frame number, present/absent bit, dirty bit, protection bits, etc.). Let's assume PTE size = 4 Bytes.
    *   Total Page Table Size = Number of Entries * Size of PTE
        = 2<sup>20</sup> entries * 4 Bytes/entry
        = 2<sup>20</sup> * 2<sup>2</sup> Bytes = 2<sup>22</sup> Bytes.
    *   Converting 2<sup>22</sup> Bytes to MB:
        2<sup>22</sup> B = 2<sup>2</sup> * 2<sup>20</sup> B = 4 * 1 MB = 4 MB.
    *   Wait, this doesn't match the option (d) 32 MB. Let's see if a different PTE size leads to an option.
        If PTE was 32 Bytes (unlikely, but to match 32MB): 2<sup>20</sup> * 32 = 2<sup>20</sup> * 2<sup>5</sup> = 2<sup>25</sup> Bytes = 32 MB. This is a very large PTE.
        If PTE was 8 Bytes: 2<sup>20</sup> * 8 = 2<sup>20</sup> * 2<sup>3</sup> = 2<sup>23</sup> Bytes = 8 MB. Option (a).
        If PTE was 16 Bytes: 2<sup>20</sup> * 16 = 2<sup>20</sup> * 2<sup>4</sup> = 2<sup>24</sup> Bytes = 16 MB. Option (b).
    *   **The RAM size (16 GB) is irrelevant for the size of a single process's page table for its *virtual* address space.**
    *   The question likely implies a standard PTE size or expects one of the options to be derivable. If we assume 8 Bytes per PTE (e.g. for a 64-bit system or larger physical address space mapping), then it's 8MB (option a).
    *   Let's re-check the options and my initial calculation. If PTE = 4 bytes, Page Table = 4MB. This is option (c).
    *   Why would (d) 32 MB be the answer? Perhaps the question has an implicit assumption or context.
    *   If we assume that for a 32-bit system, perhaps they map the page number (20 bits) to entries that are somewhat larger, or there's some overhead.
    *   **If we strictly use PTE = 4 Bytes (common for 32-bit frame numbers + control bits), the answer is 4 MB (option c).**
    *   Let's consider if any other interpretation gives 32MB. If the page directory itself (in a 2-level scheme) needs to cover the full 2^20 pages with large entries.
    *   Given the choices, and standard PTE sizes, 4MB (from 4-byte PTEs) or 8MB (from 8-byte PTEs) are more plausible. **Option (c) 4MB is the most standard answer assuming 4-byte PTEs.** If the intended answer is 32MB, the assumed PTE size would have to be 32 bytes, which is unusually large for this context.
    *   *Looking back at standard problems, often a PTE is assumed to be 4 bytes for a 32-bit system.*

**Question 25: In a pipelined processor, the instruction throughput increases because**
*   **Answer:** b) Multiple instructions are executed simultaneously (in different stages)
*   **Core Concept: Pipelining**
    *   Pipelining is a technique where multiple instructions are overlapped in execution. The pipeline is divided into stages, and each stage processes a different instruction at the same time.
    *   This doesn't reduce the execution time of a single instruction (latency), but it increases the instruction **throughput** (number of instructions completed per unit time).
    *   (a) is incorrect; pipelining doesn't change resource usage per instruction.
    *   (c) Clock cycle time might be slightly affected by stage latch overhead, but the main goal isn't to reduce it dramatically but to complete an instruction per cycle (ideally).
    *   (d) Instruction set simplicity can help pipelining (RISC vs. CISC) but isn't the direct reason for throughput increase *by* pipelining itself.

**Question 26: If a CPU has 4 registers and 32 instructions, how many bits are required for the opcode?**
*   **Answer:** b) 5
*   **Core Concept: Instruction Format (Opcode)**
    *   The opcode (operation code) part of an instruction specifies the operation to be performed (e.g., add, subtract, load, store).
    *   To uniquely identify 32 different instructions, we need `ceil(log_2(Number of Instructions))` bits.
    *   Number of bits for opcode = ceil(log<sub>2</sub>(32)) = ceil(log<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>5</sup>)) = 5 bits.
    *   The number of registers (4) is relevant for encoding register operands, not the opcode itself, unless instructions are differentiated by register usage in a very specific way not implied here.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**

**Question 27: A system has a 32 KB 2-way set associative cache and a block size of 16 bytes. How many cache lines are in one set?**
*   **Answer:** This question directly states "2-way set associative".
*   **Core Concept: Set Associative Cache**
    *   In a k-way set associative cache, each set contains `k` cache lines.
    *   Since this is a **2-way set associative cache**, each set contains **2 cache lines**.
    *   The other information (32KB cache size, 16 bytes block size) would be used to calculate the number of sets, but the question asks for lines *in one set*, which is given by the associativity.
    *   Let's look at the options if this straightforward answer isn't one of them:
        a) 1024, b) 2048, c) 4096, d) 8192.
    *   **The number of cache lines *in one set* is simply the associativity.** So, the answer should be 2.
    *   If the question meant "How many cache lines are there in total?", then:
        Total lines = (32 KB) / (16 B) = (32 * 1024) / 16 = 2 * 1024 = 2048 lines. This is option (b).
    *   If the question meant "How many sets are there?", then:
        Number of sets = Total lines / Associativity = 2048 / 2 = 1024 sets. This is option (a).
    *   Given the phrasing "How many cache lines are in **one set**?", the answer is the associativity: **2**.
    *   **Since 2 is not an option, the question is likely misinterpreted or flawed as written/OCR'd, or it's asking for something else.**
    *   If we assume the question is asking for "number of sets", then it is 1024 (option a).
    *   If we assume it's asking for "total number of cache lines", then it is 2048 (option b).
    *   **Given the phrasing, the most direct answer is 2. As it's not an option, there's an issue. If I had to pick from the options, I would assume they misphrased it and meant either "total lines" (2048 - option b) or "number of sets" (1024 - option a).** "Lines in one set" is literally the "way" number.
    *   Let's assume the question actually asks for **"Number of sets"**, then the answer is 1024 (a).
    *   Or if it asks for **"Total number of cache lines"**, the answer is 2048 (b).
    *   The provided solution key for exams usually helps here. Without it, and assuming there's a valid interpretation matching an option, "Number of sets" (1024) or "Total cache lines" (2048) are common calculations.

**Question 28: A system uses a direct-mapped cache with 512 blocks and a block size of 32 bytes. What is the size of the tag field for a 32-bit memory address?**
*   **Answer:** c) 18 bits (re-evaluating, see below)
*   **Core Concept: Direct-Mapped Cache Addressing**
    *   Physical Address (32 bits) is divided into: Tag | Index (Set) | Offset
    *   Number of Blocks (Cache Lines) = 512 = 2<sup>9</sup>.
    *   In a direct-mapped cache, Number of Sets = Number of Blocks. So, Index bits = log<sub>2</sub>(512) = 9 bits.
    *   Block Size = 32 Bytes = 2<sup>5</sup> Bytes. So, Offset bits = log<sub>2</sub>(32) = 5 bits.
    *   Tag bits = Total Address bits - Index bits - Offset bits
        = 32 - 9 - 5
        = 32 - 14 = 18 bits.
    *   Checking options: a) 19, b) 18, c) 17, d) 16.
    *   My calculation gives 18 bits. This matches option (b).
    *   The provided answer in the image snippet seems to be (c) 17 bits for this question (from the user solving it previously perhaps). Let me recheck my logic.
        Number of blocks = 512. So index needs to identify one of these 512 blocks. log<sub>2</sub>(512) = 9 bits for index.
        Block size = 32 bytes. Offset needs to identify a byte within the block. log<sub>2</sub>(32) = 5 bits for offset.
        Total bits = 32.
        Tag bits = 32 - (Index bits + Offset bits) = 32 - (9 + 5) = 32 - 14 = 18 bits.
    *   **My derivation is consistently 18 bits. So option (b) is correct.** If the intended answer was (c) 17 bits, then one of the parameters would have to change (e.g., if total address bits were 31, or index+offset was 15).

**Question 29: Which memory type is the closest to the CPU and provides fast access to frequently used data?**
*   **Answer:** a) Cache memory
*   **Core Concept: Memory Hierarchy**
    *   The memory hierarchy is organized based on speed and cost:
        1.  **Registers** (fastest, smallest, most expensive, inside CPU)
        2.  **Cache Memory** (L1, L2, L3 - very fast, small, expensive, on or very close to CPU)
        3.  **Main Memory (RAM)** (slower, larger, less expensive)
        4.  **Secondary Storage** (Hard Disk, SSD - slowest, largest, cheapest)
        5.  (Virtual memory uses disk space to extend RAM)

*   **Answer:** d) Both b and c
*   **Core Concept: Branch Hazards in Pipelining**
    *   A branch hazard (or control hazard) occurs when the pipeline makes a decision about which instruction to fetch next before the outcome of a branch instruction is known.
    *   **Techniques to handle branch hazards:**
        *   **Branch Prediction:** Guessing the outcome of the branch (taken or not taken) and speculatively fetching instructions. If the prediction is wrong, the pipeline is flushed. (Option b)
        *   **Delayed Branch:** An instruction slot immediately following the branch instruction (the delay slot) is always executed, regardless of the branch outcome. The compiler tries to fill this slot with a useful instruction. (Option c)
        *   **Pipeline Stall/Flush:** Inserting NOPs or flushing instructions if the branch outcome is not known in time.
    *   (a) Instruction Prefetch fetches instructions ahead of time but doesn't inherently solve branch direction.

*   **Answer:** a) A
*   **Core Concept: Keys in Relational Databases**
    *   **Functional Dependency (FD):** X → Y means the value of X uniquely determines the value of Y.
    *   **Superkey:** A set of attributes that uniquely identifies every tuple in a relation.

**Question 35: Which of the following properties ensures that a database transaction is completed or entirely rolled back?**
*   **Answer:** c) Atomicity
*   **Core Concept: ACID Properties of Transactions**
    *   **Atomicity:** Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. Either all its operations are completed successfully (commit), or none of them are (rollback). "All or nothing."
    *   (a) **Consistency:** Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
    *   (b) **Durability:** Ensures that once a transaction has been committed, its effects persist even if there's a system failure.
    *   (d) **Isolation:** Ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially. It controls how/when changes made by one operation become visible to others.

**Question 36: What is the role of the primary key in a database?**
*   **Answer:** a) To uniquely identify a record in a table
*   **Core Concept: Primary Key**
    *   A primary key is a specific choice of a minimal set of attributes (a candidate key) that uniquely identifies each tuple (row or record) in a table.
    *   It cannot contain NULL values.
    *   (b) Storing large data is not its role.
    *   (c) While primary keys are often indexed for performance, indexing is a separate concept. Its role is identification, not primarily indexing itself.
    *   (d) Primary keys enforce uniqueness, so they *disallow* duplicate records based on the primary key values.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**

**Question 37: A schedule is said to be conflict serializable if:**
*   **Answer:** a) It can be transformed into a serial schedule by swapping non-conflicting operations
*   **Core Concept: Conflict Serializable Schedules**
    *   A schedule is conflict serializable if it is conflict-equivalent to some serial schedule. Two operations conflict if they belong to different transactions, access the same data item, and at least one of them is a write operation.
    *   The definition in (a) describes how to check for conflict serializability by trying to transform it into a serial schedule by swapping adjacent non-conflicting operations. If this is possible, it is conflict serializable.
    *   (b) is a property of concurrent systems, but not the definition of conflict serializability.
    *   (c) is a goal of transaction management, but conflict serializability specifically relates to equivalence to a serial execution.
    *   (d) Ensuring no deadlocks is a separate issue (though related to concurrency control).

**Question 38: For a relation R(A, B, C, D) with candidate keys {A, BC}, which normal form does it violate if A → B and B → C exist?**
*   **Answer:** c) 3NF (and also BCNF, but 3NF is the lowest violated if asked this way)
*   **Core Concept: Normal Forms & Functional Dependencies**
    *   Candidate Keys: {A}, {B, C}
    *   Prime Attributes: A, B, C (attributes that are part of any candidate key)
    *   Non-Prime Attribute: D
    *   FDs given: A → B, B → C
    *   From A → B and B → C, we have a transitive dependency A → C (since A is a candidate key, this is fine so far for 3NF with respect to A determining C).

    *   **Check Violations:**
        *   **2NF:** A relation is in 2NF if it's in 1NF and every non-prime attribute is fully functionally dependent on every candidate key.
            *   FD: A → B. LHS (A) is a candidate key. OK.
            *   FD: B → C.
                *   LHS (B) is part of candidate key {B,C} but not a superkey itself (B+ = {B,C}, doesn't determine A or D).
                *   RHS (C) is a prime attribute.
            *   Partial dependency: No obvious partial dependency on non-prime attributes from parts of composite candidate keys. D is non-prime. Is D dependent on a part of BC? Not given.
            *   Consider the candidate key BC. If we have BC → D, this is fine.
            *   The issue comes from B → C. Here, C is a prime attribute, and B is a proper subset of the candidate key BC. This indicates a potential 2NF violation if B → C were a dependency of a non-prime on a part of a candidate key. But C is prime.
            *   **Let's analyze A → B and B → C more closely with candidate keys A and BC.**
                *   Prime attributes are A, B, C. Non-prime is D.
                *   A → B: A is a key. This doesn't violate 2NF or 3NF directly.
                *   B → C:
                    *   Is B a superkey? No. (B+ = {B,C})
                    *   Is C a prime attribute? Yes.
                    *   This FD (B → C) doesn't violate 2NF (as C is prime). It *could* violate 3NF or BCNF.

        *   **3NF:** A relation is in 3NF if it's in 2NF and for every FD X → Y, at least one of the following holds:
            1.  X is a superkey.
            2.  Y is a prime attribute.
            *   Consider B → C:
                1.  Is B a superkey? No (B<sup>+</sup> = {B,C}, doesn't include A or D).
                2.  Is C a prime attribute? Yes (it's part of candidate key BC).
                *   So, B → C satisfies the 3NF condition (because C is prime).

        *   **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):** For every non-trivial FD X → Y, X must be a superkey.
            *   Consider B → C:
                *   Is B → C non-trivial? Yes (B is not C).
                *   Is B a superkey? No.
                *   Therefore, B → C violates BCNF.

        *   **Re-evaluation for 3NF based on the full set of FDs and keys:**
            The FDs we have are A→B, B→C.
            From these, A→C is also derived (transitive).
            Candidate keys are A and BC.
            Prime attributes are A, B, C. Non-prime: D.

            Let's look at the dependencies with respect to 3NF:
            For X → Y to be acceptable in 3NF:
            1. X is a superkey OR
            2. Y is a prime attribute.

            FD1: A → B
            1. A is a superkey (it's a candidate key). So this is fine for 3NF and BCNF.

            FD2: B → C
            2. Is B a superkey? No. (B+ = {B,C})
            3. Is C a prime attribute? Yes (part of candidate key BC).
            So, B → C is fine for 3NF.

            However, we have A is a key. B is not a key. C is not a key (by itself).
            We have A → B (key → attribute)
            and B → C (non-key → attribute, where B is determined by a key A).
            This is a transitive dependency: A → B → C.
            A key (A) transitively determines a non-prime attribute (C) if C were non-prime.
            But here C *is* a prime attribute.

            Let's consider the definitions more strictly.
            If A is a candidate key, and BC is another candidate key.
            And we have A → B.
            And B → C.

            BCNF Violation: B → C. B is not a superkey. So BCNF is violated.
            Is 3NF violated?
            For B → C: B is not a superkey. C *is* a prime attribute. So B → C *does not* violate 3NF by its own definition.

            However, the situation A → B and B → C often implies a transitive dependency of a non-key attribute if C were non-prime.
            What if we have another non-prime attribute D, and, say, C → D? Then A → B → C → D would be a transitive dependency of D on A, violating 3NF. But D is not involved in the given FDs.

            Let's re-read the question carefully. Candidate keys {A, BC}. FDs A → B, B → C.
            BC is a candidate key means BC → D (and BC→A, BC→B, BC→C are trivial or implied).
            A is a candidate key means A → D (and A→B, A→C are implied by given FDs).

            Consider the FD B → C.
            LHS (B) is not a superkey.
            RHS (C) is a prime attribute (part of CK {BC}).
            So B → C by itself does *not* violate 3NF. It *does* violate BCNF.

            If the question asks "which normal form does it violate," it usually means the highest one it *fails* to be. If it violates BCNF, it might still be in 3NF.

            This is a classic example of a relation that is in 3NF but not in BCNF.
            R(A,B,C,D)
            CKs: A, BC
            FDs: A→B, B→C (given). From these A→C. Implied: A→D, BC→D, BC→A.
            FD: B→C
            Is B a superkey? No.
            Violates BCNF.

            Is it in 3NF? Check all FDs:
            4. A→B: A is key. OK for 3NF.
            5. B→C: B is not key, but C is prime. OK for 3NF.
            6. A→D: A is key. OK for 3NF.
            7. BC→D: BC is key. OK for 3NF.
            8. BC→A: BC is key. OK for 3NF.

            So, it seems the relation is in 3NF, but not in BCNF due to B → C.
            Thus, it *violates* BCNF.
            If the options imply "what is the highest normal form it is NOT IN or violates starting from the top down (BCNF, 3NF, 2NF)":
            It violates BCNF.
            If it violates BCNF, does it also violate 3NF based on how the question is usually phrased?
            No, it can be in 3NF but not BCNF.

            Let's check the options: a) 1NF (INF is likely 1NF), b) 2NF, c) 3NF, d) BCNF.
            If the question means "which normal form constraint is broken by the given dependencies", B → C breaks the BCNF rule that the LHS must be a superkey.

            If the question is interpreted as "What is the highest normal form it *fails* to achieve?" or "What normal form rules are violated?", then BCNF is violated by B→C.

            If the question implies that because of A→B and B→C, there is a transitive dependency of C on A *via* B, and this setup (where B is not a key) means it's not "fully" clean in the spirit of 3NF if we consider how these FDs interact.
            A → B, and A is a key.
            B → C, and B is not a key. C is determined by B, which is determined by A.
            This is a transitive dependency: A → B → C.
            For 3NF, no non-prime attribute should be transitively dependent on a candidate key.
            Here, C is a prime attribute. So the standard definition of 3NF (no transitive dependency of a *non-prime* attribute) is not violated.

            However, some interpretations or definitions for "violating 3NF" are stricter.
            The common case of BCNF violation where 3NF holds is when X → Y, X is not a superkey, but Y is prime. This is exactly B → C.
            So it *is* in 3NF, but *violates* BCNF.
            The question asks "which normal form does it violate". It violates BCNF.
            So answer should be **d) BCNF**.

            If (d) BCNF is the answer, then option (c) 3NF would imply it violates 3NF.
            A relation violating BCNF is not necessarily violating 3NF.
            A relation violating 3NF also violates BCNF (since BCNF is stricter).
            A relation violating 2NF also violates 3NF and BCNF.

            The FD B→C clearly violates BCNF because B is not a superkey.
            Does it violate 3NF? For B→C: B is not a superkey, C is a prime attribute. This dependency is allowed in 3NF.
            So, the relation IS in 3NF. It VIOLATES BCNF.

            Therefore, the answer is **d) BCNF**.

*   **Answer:** b) Names of employees older than 30
*   **Core Concept: Relational Algebra**

**Question 40: Consider a B+ tree with order 4. What is the maximum number of keys that can be stored in a node?**
*   **Answer:** b) 3
*   **Core Concept: B+ Tree Order**
    *   The **order `p`** of a B+ tree (sometimes denoted `m`) defines the maximum number of *children* an internal node can have.
    *   An internal node with `p` children has `p-1` keys.
    *   A leaf node also typically holds up to `p-1` keys (or `p-1` data records/pointers depending on the B+ tree variant).
    *   If order is 4 (meaning max 4 children for internal nodes), then the maximum number of keys in any node (internal or leaf) is `order - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.
    *   Minimum keys in an internal node (except root) is `ceil(p/2) - 1`.
    *   Minimum keys in a leaf node (except root if it's also a leaf) is `floor(p/2)` or `ceil(p/2)-1` depending on definition.

**Question 44: Regular expression for all strings starts with ab and ends with bba is.**
*   **Answer:** c) ab(a+b)*bba
*   **Core Concept: Regular Expressions**
    *   `ab`: The string must start with "ab".
    *   `bba`: The string must end with "bba".
    *   `(a+b)*` or `(a|b)*`: Represents any sequence of 'a's and 'b's, including the empty sequence. This part goes in the middle, between the fixed start and end.
    *   So, `ab` followed by `any string of a's and b's` followed by `bba`.
    *   This translates to `ab(a+b)*bba`.
    *   (a) `aba*b*bba`: This would force an 'a' after 'ab', then any 'b's. Doesn't allow `abbba` for example.

**Question 49: Which of the following statements are false?**
*   **Answer:** c) Recursive languages may not be recursively enumerable (This is false, because Recursive is a SUBSET of Recursively Enumerable)
*   **Core Concept: Recursive and Recursively Enumerable Languages**
    *   **Recursively Enumerable (RE) Language:** A language for which there exists a Turing Machine that will accept (and halt) any string in the language. If a string is not in the language, the TM might halt and reject, or it might loop forever. (Type-0)
    *   **Recursive Language (REC):** A language for which there exists a Turing Machine that will accept any string in the language and halt, AND will reject any string not in the language and halt. It always halts.
    *   **Relationship:** Every Recursive language is also Recursively Enumerable (REC ⊂ RE). However, not every RE language is Recursive (e.g., the language corresponding to the Halting Problem is RE but not Recursive).

    *   Let's analyze the statements:
        *   a) "Every recursive language is recursively enumerable": **True**.
        *   b) "Recursively enumerable language may not be recursive": **True** (e.g., the Halting Problem language).
        *   c) "Recursive languages may not be recursively enumerable": **False**. By definition, if a language is Recursive, it *is* Recursively Enumerable because the TM that decides it (always halts) also serves as a TM that enumerates/accepts it.
        *   d) "None of the mentioned"
    *   The question asks for the FALSE statement. Statement (c) is false.
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**

**Question 50: If L is a recursive language, L' is:**
*   **Answer:** a) Recursive
*   **Core Concept: Closure Properties of Recursive Languages**
    *   Recursive languages are closed under complementation.
    *   If L is a recursive language, there's a Turing Machine M that always halts and decides L (accepts strings in L, rejects strings not in L).
    *   To decide L' (the complement of L), we can construct a Turing Machine M' that simulates M. If M accepts, M' rejects. If M rejects, M' accepts. Since M always halts, M' also always halts.
    *   Therefore, L' is also recursive.
    *   (b) Recursively Enumerable: While L' would also be RE (since REC ⊂ RE), "Recursive" is the more specific and correct classification.
    *   (c) Recursive and Recursively Enumerable: This is true in the sense that it IS recursive, and therefore also RE. But "Recursive" is the tightest class.
    *   **Given "Recursive" is an option, it's the best and most precise answer.**
*   **Related Concepts/Similar Questions:**
    *   Recursively Enumerable languages are NOT closed under complementation. (If L and L' are both RE, then L is Recursive).
    *   Other closure properties of REC and RE languages (e.g., union, intersection, concatenation, Kleene star).
