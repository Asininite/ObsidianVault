### Priori
- done **prior** to 
- absolute analysis
- independent of language of compiler and types of hardware
- gives approximate answer
- uses asymptotic notations
- time complexity is same across different systems
- programming is to be credited for the algorithm performance

### Posteriori
- relative analysis
- dependent on language of compiler and hardware type
- gives exact answer
- doesn't use asymptotic notations
- time complexity differs across systems
- credit goes to compiler and hardware
