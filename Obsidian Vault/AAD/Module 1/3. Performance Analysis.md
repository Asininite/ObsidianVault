- select best algorithm to solve problem
	whether algorithm provides an exact solution to the proble,
	whether easy to understand
	how much space/memory
	how much time taken

- **Space Complexity** : includes program space and data space
	fixed part : space to store data and variables independent of size of program
		does not depend on size of input or output
	variable part : space required by variables whose size varies
	
$S(P) = C$ {fixed part} $+ SP(1)$ {variable part}
	
	Frequency count : number of times the statement is executed in the program

- **Time Complexity** : time required to complete the task
	function T(n) [n is size of input]
	total time = compile time + execution time
	
	$T(P) = C [constant] + TP(I) [variable part]$


- Worst Case Complexity
  function defined by **maximum number of steps** taken on any instance of size n
- Best Case Complexity
  function defined by **minimum number of steps** taken on any instance of size n
- Average Case Complexity
  function defined by **average number of steps** taken on any instance of size n

### Methods to obtain Step counts
- Counting Method / Frequency count method
- Tabular Method


	comments / declaration statements
		`0`
	initialization / expressions / assignment statements
		`1`
	iteration statements
		`depends on loop size`
	condition / switch statement
		`header switch 1 then the rest`
	function call 
		`1`
	break / continue / return
		`1`
	memory management statement
		`malloc calloc : 1`
	function statements
		`don't count`
	jump statements
		`continue break return 1`

- for the above question, since i increments by 2 **divide** n by 2 and all the loop elements will be n/2
