- select best algorithm to solve problem

- **Space Complexity** : includes program space and data space
	fixed part : space to store data and variables independent of size of program
	variable part : space required by variables whose size varies
	S(P) = C [ fixed part] + SP(I) [variable part]

	Frequency count : number of times the statement is executed in the program

- **Time Complexity** : time required to complete the task
	function T(n) [n is size of input]
	total time = compile time + execution time
	T(P) = C [constant] + TP(I) [variable part]
