- step by step procedure with defined instructions executed in order to get output

### characteristics
- input : take zero or more inputs
	can be data values, parameters or states
- output : provides atleast one output that represents solution or result
- finiteness : must terminate after finite steps
- definiteness : each step should be unambiguously defined
- effectiveness : each operation should be basic enough to be carried out with a finite amount of resources in a reasonable time
	computational time and memory should be less

### analysis of algorithms
- correctness 
- time complexity
- space complexity
- simplicity and clarity
- optimality
