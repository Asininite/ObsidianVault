### characteristics
- take zero or more inputs
	can be data values, parameters or states
- provides atleast one output that represents solution or result
- must terminate after finite steps
- each step should be unambiguously defined
- effectiveness : each operation should be basic enough to be carried out with a finite amount of resources in a reasonable time
	computational time and memory should be less
