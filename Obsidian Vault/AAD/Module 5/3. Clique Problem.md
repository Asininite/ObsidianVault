- clique of a graph (G,E) is a complete subgraph of a graph G
- It is a subset of v' $\subseteq$ v such that for every pair of vertices in v' there is a corresponding edge in G

**Edges:** Create an edge between two vertices v<sub>ri</sub> and v<sub>sj</sub> **if and only if** both of the following conditions are met:

1. They are in different clauses (r ≠ s). Vertices representing literals within the same clause are never connected.
    
2. The literals they represent are not negations of each other (l<sub>ri</sub> is not ¬l<sub>sj</sub>). For example, if v<sub>ri</sub> represents x1 and v<sub>sj</sub> represents ¬x1, there is no edge between them. But if v<sub>ri</sub> represents x1 and v<sub>sj</sub> represents x2 (or x1, or ¬x3), an edge is added (provided r ≠ s)


### CLIQUE proving NP-Hard
	- CLIQUE can be proved to be in NP-Hard by doing polynomial time reduction of a NP-Complete Problem (independent set problem : finding subset of vertices in a graph where no two vertices are connected by an edge)
