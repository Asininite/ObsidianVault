- clique of a graph (G,E) is a complete subgraph of a graph G
- It is a subset of v' $\subseteq$ v such that for every pair of vertices in v' there is a corresponding edge in G

### CLIQUE proving NP-Hard
	- CLIQUE can be proved to be in NP-Hard by doing polynomial time reduction of a NP-Complete Problem (independent set problem : finding subset of vertices in a graph where no two vertices are connected by an edge)
