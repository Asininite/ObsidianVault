### P-Class (Polynomial time)
- problems that can be solved in polynomial time -> $O(n^k)$ where n is size of input and k is constant
- sorting, GCD, matrix multiplication
- eg : PATH PROBLEM : directed path existing from s to t for graph G

- Single Source Shortest Path problem using Dijkstra‟s Greedy method.
- Multistage Graph problem implemented using forward or backward dynamic
programming.
- Minimum cost spanning tree using Prim‟s or Kruskal‟s method.

### NP-Class (non-deterministic polynomial time)
- problems **can't be solved** in polynomial time but **can be verified** in polynomial time
- or
- problems that can be **solved in polynomial time** using **non-deterministic algorithm**  
	  eg : Travelling Salesman Problem, Knapsack, Sudoku
- checking a sudoku problem is easier compared to solving it
- **non-polynomial algorithm and polynomial time verifier**
##### eg : CLIQUE PROBLEM

- **Reduction** 
	  A reduces B is there is a way to solve A by deterministic algorithm that solves B in polynomial time![[Pasted image 20250507112021.png]]

### NP-Hard
- if every problem in NP can be polynomially reduced
- **A problem H is NP-Hard if every problem L in NP can be reduced to H in polynomial time (L ≤<sub>p</sub> H for all L ∈ NP).**
1. **"At Least As Hard As" the Hardest in NP:** This is the most crucial takeaway. If a problem is NP-Hard, it means it's at least as difficult to solve as any problem in the entire NP class, including the NP-Complete problems (which are the hardest within NP). It could potentially be even harder.
    
2. **The "Universal Solver" Implication:** If you were to discover a magical, efficient (polynomial-time) algorithm for any single NP-Hard problem, you could use that algorithm (combined with the polynomial-time reductions that are guaranteed to exist) to efficiently solve every single problem in NP. This would be revolutionary and would prove that P = NP. Since most computer scientists believe P ≠ NP, finding a general polynomial-time algorithm for an NP-Hard problem is considered highly unlikely.
    
3. **Not Necessarily in NP:** This is a key distinction between NP-Hard and NP-Complete. An NP-Hard problem **does not have to be in the class NP**.
    
    - **Decision Problem Not Required:** NP-Hard problems don't even need to be decision problems (yes/no answer). Optimization problems (like finding the absolute shortest path in TSP) are often NP-Hard.
        
    - **Verification Not Required:** Even if it is a decision problem, there's no requirement that a proposed solution can be verified in polynomial time. The hardness definition only relates to its difficulty relative to all problems in NP via reduction.
