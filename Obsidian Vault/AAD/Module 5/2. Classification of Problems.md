### P-Class (Polynomial time)
- problems that can be solved in polynomial time -> $O(n^k)$ where n is size of input and k is constant
- sorting, GCD, matrix multiplication
- eg : PATH PROBLEM : directed path existing from s to t for graph G

- Single Source Shortest Path problem using Dijkstra‟s Greedy method.
- Multistage Graph problem implemented using forward or backward dynamic
programming.
- Minimum cost spanning tree using Prim‟s or Kruskal‟s method.

### NP-Class (non-deterministic polynomial time)
- problems **can't be solved** in polynomial time but **can be verified** in polynomial time
- or
- problems that can be **solved in polynomial time** using **non-deterministic algorithm**  
	  eg : Travelling Salesman Problem, Knapsack, Sudoku
- checking a sudoku problem is easier compared to solving it
- **non-polynomial algorithm and polynomial time verifier**
##### eg : CLIQUE PROBLEM

- **Reduction** 
	  A reduces B is there is a way to solve A by deterministic algorithm that solves B in polynomial time![[Pasted image 20250507112021.png]]

### NP-Hard
- if every problem in NP can be polynomially reduced
