### P-Class (Polynomial time)
- problem can be solved in polynomial time
- sorting, GCD, matrix multiplication

### NP-Class (non-deterministic polynomial time)
- problems **can't be solved** in polynomial time but **can be verified** in polynomial time
- or
- problems that can be **solved in polynomial time** using **non-deterministic algorithm**  
	  eg : Travelling Salesman Problem, Knapsack, Sudoku
- checking a sudoku problem is easier compared to solving it

- **Reduction** 
	  A reduces B is there is a way to solve A by deterministic algorithm that solves B in polynomial time
