- decision taken on currently available information
- construct solution in an optimal way, algo has two sets
	  one with chosen items
	  one with rejected items
- solution either optimal or feasible

```
algorithm greedy(a, n){
	for i = 1 to n do{
		x = select(a);
		if feasible(x) then {
			soln_set = soln_set + x;
		}
	}
}
