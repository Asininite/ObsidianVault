- remove loops or parallel edges based on maximum weight
- write edges in increasing order of weight
- in new graph draw edges in such a way that min weight is chosen and after addition no cycle is formed

1. edges of graph are considered in increasing order of cost
2. if selected edge forms cycle, **discard it** 
3. selection process continues till there is $n-1$ edges

Okay, let's solve this using Kruskal's Algorithm with the added constraint that vertex 0 must be a leaf node in the resulting Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

**1. Understand the Graph and Constraint**

*   **Graph:** We have a complete undirected graph with 5 vertices: V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
*   **Weights:** The weights are given by the matrix W, where W<sub>ij</sub> is the weight of the edge between vertex `i` and vertex `j`.
    *   W<sub>01</sub>=1, W<sub>02</sub>=8, W<sub>03</sub>=1, W<sub>04</sub>=4
    *   W<sub>12</sub>=12, W<sub>13</sub>=4, W<sub>14</sub>=9
    *   W<sub>23</sub>=7, W<sub>24</sub>=3
    *   W<sub>34</sub>=2
*   **Constraint:** Vertex 0 must be a leaf node in the final MST. A leaf node has a degree of 1, meaning it connects to exactly one other vertex in the tree.
*   **MST Size:** An MST for a graph with |V|=5 vertices will have |V|-1 = 4 edges.

**2. Strategy with the Constraint**

The most straightforward way to apply Kruskal's while ensuring vertex 0 is a leaf node is:

*   **Step A:** Find the MST for the subgraph excluding vertex 0 (i.e., for vertices {1, 2, 3, 4}). This subgraph has 4 vertices, so its MST will have 4-1 = 3 edges.
*   **Step B:** Connect vertex 0 to the MST found in Step A using the single *cheapest* edge possible between vertex 0 and any vertex in {1, 2, 3, 4}. This ensures vertex 0 is connected with only one edge (making it a leaf) and that this connection uses the minimum possible weight.

**3. Step A: Kruskal's Algorithm on Subgraph {1, 2, 3, 4}**

*   **List and Sort Edges within {1, 2, 3, 4}:**
    *   (3, 4): weight 2
    *   (2, 4): weight 3
    *   (1, 3): weight 4
    *   (2, 3): weight 7
    *   (1, 4): weight 9
    *   (1, 2): weight 12
*   **Initialize Disjoint Sets:** {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}
*   **Iterate through sorted edges:**
    1.  **Edge (3, 4), weight 2:** Vertices 3 and 4 are in different sets. Add edge (3, 4) to the subgraph MST. Perform Union(3, 4).
        *   MST Cost = 2
        *   Sets: {1}, {2}, {3, 4}
        *   Edges in MST: 1
    2.  **Edge (2, 4), weight 3:** Vertices 2 and 4 are in different sets (2 is in {2}, 4 is in {3, 4}). Add edge (2, 4) to the subgraph MST. Perform Union(2, 4).
        *   MST Cost = 2 + 3 = 5
        *   Sets: {1}, {2, 3, 4}
        *   Edges in MST: 2
    3.  **Edge (1, 3), weight 4:** Vertices 1 and 3 are in different sets (1 is in {1}, 3 is in {2, 3, 4}). Add edge (1, 3) to the subgraph MST. Perform Union(1, 3).
        *   MST Cost = 5 + 4 = 9
        *   Sets: {1, 2, 3, 4}
        *   Edges in MST: 3
*   **Stop:** We have added 3 edges, which is |V'|-1 for the subgraph. The MST for vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} has edges {(3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 3)} and a total cost of 9.

**4. Step B: Connect Vertex 0 with the Cheapest Edge**

*   Examine the edges connecting vertex 0 to the vertices {1, 2, 3, 4}:
    *   (0, 1): weight 1
    *   (0, 3): weight 1
    *   (0, 4): weight 4
    *   (0, 2): weight 8
*   The cheapest edges are (0, 1) and (0, 3), both with weight 1. We must choose exactly one of these to make vertex 0 a leaf. We select the minimum weight, which is 1. (We can choose either (0,1) or (0,3)).

**5. Calculate Final MST Cost**

*   Total Cost = Cost of MST for {1, 2, 3, 4} + Cost of cheapest edge connecting 0
*   Total Cost = 9 + 1 = 10

**Conclusion:**

The cost of the Minimum Spanning Tree T using Kruskal's Algorithm, such that vertex 0 is a leaf node, is **10**.
