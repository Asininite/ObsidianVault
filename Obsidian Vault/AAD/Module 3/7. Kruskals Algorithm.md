- remove loops or parallel edges based on maximum weight
- write edges in increasing order of weight
- in new graph draw edges in such a way that min weight is chosen and after addition no cycle is formed

1. edges of graph are considered in increasing order of cost
2. if selected edge forms cycle, **discard it** 
3. selection process continues till there is $n-1$ edges
