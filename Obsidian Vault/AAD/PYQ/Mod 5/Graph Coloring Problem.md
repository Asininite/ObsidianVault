**Vertex Coloring Problem Definition:**
	Given an undirected graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges, the vertex coloring problem is to assign a color to each vertex v ∈ V such that **no two adjacent vertices (i.e., vertices connected by an edge) share the same color.**

**chromatic number** : smallest integer k for which graph is k-colorable


- **Edge Coloring:** Assign colors to edges such that no two edges incident to the same vertex have the same color. The minimum number of colors needed is the chromatic index.
    
- **Total Coloring:** Assign colors to both vertices and edges such that no adjacent vertices, no adjacent edges, and no incident vertex and edge have the same color.
