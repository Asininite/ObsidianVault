```cpp
vector<int> v; creates empty container

v.push_back(1); 1 inserted into container at end
v.emplace_back(2); dynamically increases size and pushes 2 in back

vector <pair<int,int>> v;

v.push_back({1,2});
v.emplace_back(1, 2); it can recognize that the vector is a pair, thus no curly needed

```
