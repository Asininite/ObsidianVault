```cpp
vector<int> v; creates empty container

v.push_back(1); 1 inserted into container at end
v.emplace_back(2); dynamically increases size and pushes 2 in back

vector <pair<int,int>> v;

v.push_back({1,2});
v.emplace_back(1, 2); it can recognize that the vector is a pair, thus no curly needed

vector <int> v(5, 100); this is {100, 100, 100, 100, 100}
we can use push_back or emplace_back to dynamically increase size

access vectors by
1. similar to arrays
	   v[1] = 2nd element
2. iterator
	   
```
