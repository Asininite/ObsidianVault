Spatial resolution refers to ==the ability of an image or sensor to distinguish between two closely spaced objects, or the level of detail captured in an image==. It's essentially a measure of how much "small stuff" an image can show. Higher spatial resolution means finer details are discernible, while lower resolution means smaller details are lost

Gray-level resolution, in the context of digital images, ==refers to the number of distinct gray shades (brightness levels) that can be represented in an image==. It's determined by the number of bits used to represent each pixel's intensity, often expressed as a power of 2. For example, an 8-bit grayscale image has 256 (2^8) different gray levels.
