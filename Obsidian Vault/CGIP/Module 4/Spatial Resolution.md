Spatial resolution refers to ==the ability of an image or sensor to distinguish between two closely spaced objects, or the level of detail captured in an image==. It's essentially a measure of how much "small stuff" an image can show. Higher spatial resolution means finer details are discernible, while lower resolution means smaller details are lost
