- process by which digital image is partitioned into various subgroups (of pixels) called **IMAGE OBJECTS** which reduce complexity of image and make analyzing easier

## Similarity Detection (Region Approach)
- detect similar pixels in image, based on a threshhold

## Discontinuity Detection (Boundary Approach)
