### Raster Scan
- electron beam swept across the screen one row at a time from top-to-bottom
	  beam intensity turned on and off to create a pattern of illuminated spots
- picture definition stored in an area called **refresh buffer** or **frame buffer**
	  stores set of intensity values for all screen points
	  stored values retrieved and painted onto the screen
- eg : TV and Printer
- for bi-level system where intensity value is 1 or 0, only 1 bit is needed to indicate that the beam intensity should be off or on
