### beam-penetration method
- used with random scan monitors
- two layers of phosphor (red and green) coated onto inside of CRT screen 
- beam of **slow electrons** excite the **red** layer
- beam of **fast electrons** penetrate the red and excite the **green** layer
- at **intermediate speeds** combination of **red and green light** gives orange and yellow
- screen color controlled by **beam acceleration voltage** 
- cheap but low quality

### shadow-mask method
- used in raster scan method
- shadow mask CRT has **three** **color** phosphor **dots** at each **pixel** **position**
- CRT has three electron guns for each color dot and a **shadow mask grid** behind the phosphor-coated screen
- when the three electron beams pass through hole in the mask, they activate **dot triangle** which appears as small color spot
- vary the **intensity** **levels** of the beams to obtain color variations

### Direct-View Storage Tubes
- DVST stores the picture information as a charge distribution behind the phosphor-coated screen
- two electron guns : **primary gun** used to store picture pattern, **flood gun** to maintain the picture display
- very high resolutions but no colour and takes time
