- take a line segment from point to be analyzed to point outside polygon
- if there is **odd number** of intersections, the point is **inside**
- if there is **even number** of intersections, the point is **outside** 
- if edges intersect at a **vertex**
	  if other points are on the **same side** of scan line, intersections is **2 or even**
	  if other points are on **different sides** of scan lines, intersections is **1 or odd**
