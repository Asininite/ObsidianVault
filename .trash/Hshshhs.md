So I like put my hand around her shoulder and suddenly realised she had a bf... And I didn't wanna feel like I was doing stuff he usually does .. like put hands around her .. I asked her if ith ok aano bcus I wanted to establish boundaries.. I didn't wanna make her feel uncomfortable with me enn 

What I said was 'am i being touchy?'
